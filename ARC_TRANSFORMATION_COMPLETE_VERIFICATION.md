## Technical Architecture

### Two Arc Systems Supported

#### 1. New System (Arc with is_curved flag)
- **Arc type:** `Arc`, `InhibitorArc`
- **Curve flag:** `is_curved` boolean
- **Control point:** `control_offset_x`, `control_offset_y` (relative to midpoint)
- **Constraint:** Applied via `_update_control_point()`
- **Straight toggle:** Sets `is_curved = False` and offsets to 0.0

#### 2. Legacy System (CurvedArc class)
- **Arc type:** `CurvedArc`, `CurvedInhibitorArc`
- **Curve flag:** N/A (always curved by default)
- **Control point:** `manual_control_point` (absolute position, optional)
- **Automatic:** Uses `_calculate_curve_control_point()` with 20% offset ratio
- **Constraint:** Applied via `_update_curved_arc_control_point()`
- **Straight toggle:** Sets `manual_control_point = None`

### Transformation Handler Logic

```
User clicks handle:
  ├─ If not dragged (click only):
  │   ├─ Toggle curved ↔ straight
  │   ├─ If switching to straight: eliminate offsets
  │   └─ If switching to curved: set default offsets
  └─ If dragged:
      ├─ Update control point position
      ├─ Apply MAX_CURVE_OFFSET constraint
      └─ Store new control point/offsets
```

### Context Menu Detection (contains_point)

```
contains_point(x, y):
  ├─ Check if arc is curved:
  │   ├─ CurvedArc: check manual_control_point or auto-calculated
  │   └─ Arc: check is_curved flag and control_offset_x/y
  ├─ If curved:
  │   └─ Sample 20 points along bezier curve, check distance
  └─ If straight:
      └─ Check distance from point to line segment
```

## Constraint Values

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| MAX_CURVE_OFFSET | 200.0 pixels | Maximum distance control point can be from arc midpoint |
| MIN_CURVE_OFFSET | 20.0 pixels | Minimum curve offset when creating default curve |
| TOLERANCE | 10.0 pixels | Hit detection tolerance for contains_point |
| BEZIER_SAMPLES | 20 | Number of points sampled for curved arc hit detection |
| CURVE_OFFSET_RATIO | 0.2 (20%) | Automatic curve offset for CurvedArc (legacy) |

## Visual Rendering

### Straight Arcs
1. Draw straight line from source boundary to target boundary
2. For inhibitor arcs: line stops before hollow circle marker
3. Position marker at target boundary

### Curved Arcs
1. Calculate control point (manual or automatic)
2. Draw quadratic bezier curve
3. For inhibitor arcs: curve extends to target center (clipped by marker)
4. Position marker at target boundary with correct tangent
5. Weight label positioned on curve at t=0.5

### Selection Rendering
- Blue outline follows actual arc path (straight or curved)
- Includes parallel arc offset when applicable
- Handle shown at control point for curved arcs

---

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **Degenerate arcs** (source = target): Falls back to straight line  
✅ **Very short arcs** (< 1 pixel): Skips rendering  
✅ **Parallel arcs**: Offset applied to separate visual paths  
✅ **Multiple transformations**: State preserved correctly  
✅ **Zero offsets**: Treated as straight arc  
✅ **Extreme drag distances**: Clamped to MAX_CURVE_OFFSET  
✅ **Both orientations**: Place→Transition and Transition→Place  

---

## Performance Characteristics

- **Rendering:** O(1) for straight arcs, O(n) for curved with n=bezier samples
- **Hit detection:** O(1) for straight arcs, O(n) for curved with n=20 samples
- **Transformation:** O(1) for all operations
- **Memory:** +16 bytes per Arc (control_offset_x/y), +16 bytes per CurvedArc (manual_control_point)

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Existing .shy files**: Fully compatible  
✅ **CurvedArc instances**: Continue to work with automatic calculation  
✅ **Arc instances**: Can be toggled curved/straight without migration  
✅ **Serialization**: No changes needed to file format  

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Cubic bezier curves**: Support for two control points
2. **Smooth curves**: Automatic curve smoothing for multiple connected arcs
3. **Arc routing**: Automatic routing to avoid overlapping nodes
4. **Custom markers**: Additional arc types (reset, read, transport)
5. **Animation**: Smooth transition when toggling curved/straight

---

✅ Size constraints properly enforced  
✅ Offsets eliminated when returning to straight
