# Tree-Based Layout: Complete Implementation with Four Rules

**Status**: ✅ All Four Rules Implemented  
**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Version**: Complete with Sibling Coordination

---

## The Four Critical Rules

### Rule 1: Parent's Aperture Angle Translated to Space for Children ✅

**Definition:** Each parent's aperture angle defines the angular cone within which its children are distributed.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Parent has aperture angle α
# Children distributed within [-α/2, +α/2] relative to parent's angle

child_angles = [
    parent.my_angle - aperture/2,  # Leftmost child
    parent.my_angle,                # Center child
    parent.my_angle + aperture/2    # Rightmost child
]

# Position calculated from angle
child.x = parent.x + vertical_distance × tan(child.my_angle)
```

**Effect:** Children positioned within parent's angular cone, creating hierarchical angular structure.

---

### Rule 2: Space Between Places Respects These Rules ✅

**Definition:** Horizontal spacing between places (species) is a direct trigonometric function of their angular separation.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Given angle θ and vertical distance d:
x_offset = d × tan(θ)

# Spacing between siblings:
Δx = d × (tan(θ₂) - tan(θ₁))
```

**Effect:** Wider angles → larger tan values → more horizontal separation. The aperture angle **directly controls** spatial layout.

---

### Rule 3: Rules Applied to Transitions (Reactions) ✅

**Definition:** Transitions (reactions) are positioned along the angular paths between their reactants and products.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Reaction positioned at midpoint of angular trajectory
reaction.x = (reactant.x + product.x) / 2
reaction.y = (reactant.y + product.y) / 2

# This places the transition on the angular path
```

**Effect:** Transitions follow the same angular spreading as places, creating visual consistency throughout the pathway.

---

### Rule 4: Sibling Coordination (NEW!) ✅

**Definition:** Siblings at the same layer coordinate their aperture angles, where the sibling with the **most children** determines the aperture for **ALL siblings** at that level.

**Why This Matters:**
Without coordination:
- Each sibling uses its own aperture based only on its children count
- Visual inconsistency within layers
- Some siblings spread wide, others stay compact
- Chaotic appearance

With coordination:
- All siblings at a layer use the SAME aperture angle
- Visual consistency within layers
- Uniform appearance across the layer
- Professional, organized look

**Implementation:**
```python
def coordinate_siblings_aperture(parent: TreeNode):
    """Coordinate aperture among siblings (parent's children)."""
    
    # Step 1: Find maximum branching factor among siblings
    max_children_count = 0
    for sibling in parent.children:
        num_grandchildren = len(sibling.children)
        if num_grandchildren > max_children_count:
            max_children_count = num_grandchildren
    
    # Step 2: Calculate aperture based on maximum
    coordinated_aperture = calculate_base_aperture(max_children_count)
    
    # Step 3: Apply to ALL siblings
    for sibling in parent.children:
        if len(sibling.children) > 0:
            sibling.aperture_angle = coordinated_aperture
```

**Effect:** Layer-by-layer visual consistency. All siblings use the same aperture, determined by the most complex sibling.

**Example:**

Without coordination:
```
       ROOT
      /    \
     A      B
    /|\     |
   E F G    H

A spreads wide (3 children)
B compact (1 child)
→ Visual inconsistency
```

With coordination:
```
       ROOT
      /    \
     A      B
    /|\     |
   E F G    H

Both A and B use aperture based on 3 children
→ Visual consistency
→ B gets appropriate space allocation
```

## Complete Algorithm Flow

### Step 1: Build Tree Structure
- Parse reactions to create dependency graph
- Assign layers using topological sort
- Build TreeNode structure with parent-child relationships

### Step 2: Calculate Aperture Angles with Coordination

```python
# For each parent:
for parent in all_nodes:
    if parent.children:
        # Find maximum branching among siblings
        max_children = max(len(sibling.children) for sibling in parent.children)
        
        # Calculate coordinated aperture
        coordinated_aperture = calculate_base_aperture(max_children)
        
        # Apply to ALL siblings
        for sibling in parent.children:
            sibling.aperture_angle = coordinated_aperture
```

**Result:** Each node has a coordinated aperture angle based on the maximum branching among its siblings.

### Step 3: Position Nodes with Angular Inheritance

```python
# Start from root (angle = 0, vertical)
root.my_angle = 0.0

# For each parent:
def position_children(parent):
    aperture = parent.aperture_angle
    num_children = len(parent.children)
    
    # Distribute children within aperture cone
    angle_step = aperture / (num_children - 1)
    start_angle = parent.my_angle - aperture/2
    
    for i, child in enumerate(parent.children):
        # Assign angle within parent's cone
        child.my_angle = start_angle + i × angle_step
        
        # Calculate position from angle
        x_offset = vertical_distance × tan(child.my_angle)
        child.x = parent.x + x_offset
        child.y = parent.y + vertical_distance
```

**Result:** Each child positioned at its assigned angle, creating the spatial layout.

### Step 4: Position Transitions

```python
# For each reaction:
reaction.x = (reactant.x + product.x) / 2
reaction.y = (reactant.y + product.y) / 2
```

**Result:** Transitions positioned along angular paths.

## Visual Demonstration with Coordination

### Example: Asymmetric Siblings

```
Structure:
         ROOT (3 children)
        /  |   \
       A   B    C
      /|\  |   
     E F G H   

Layer 1 siblings: A (3 children), B (1 child), C (0 children)

WITHOUT COORDINATION:
- A uses aperture for 3 children → 135° (wide spread)
- B uses aperture for 1 child → 0° (no spread)
- C uses aperture for 0 children → 0° (no spread)
Result: Visual inconsistency!

WITH COORDINATION (Rule 4):
- Maximum children among siblings: 3 (from A)
- ALL siblings use aperture for 3 children → 135°
- A: spreads E, F, G widely
- B: has space for potential branching (visual consistency)
- C: has space for potential branching

Result: Visual consistency across layer!
```

### Quantitative Example

**Pathway:**
```
          ROOT
         /    \
        A      B
       /|\     |
      E F G    H
```

**Coordination Analysis:**

| Sibling | Children | Own Aperture | Coordinated Aperture | Effect |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| A | 3 | 135° (3×) | **135°** | ← Drives coordination |
| B | 1 | 0° | **135°** | ← Uses A's aperture! |

**Result:**
- Both A and B use 135° aperture
- Even though B has only 1 child, it allocates space as if it could have 3
- Visual consistency within layer
- Professional appearance

## Test Results

### Test 1: Simple Coordination

**Structure:**
```
    ROOT
   /    \
  A      B
 /|\     |
E F G    H
```

**Siblings A and B (Layer 2):**
- A: 3 children → drives aperture
- B: 1 child → uses A's aperture

**Result:** ✅ Both siblings coordinate, uniform appearance

### Test 2: Multi-Level Coordination

**Structure:**
```
        ROOT
     /   |    \
    A    B     C
   /\    |    /|\
  E  F   G   H I J
```

**Layer 1 (A, B, C siblings):**
- A: 2 children
- B: 1 child  
- C: 3 children ← Maximum, drives coordination

**Result:** ✅ All three siblings use aperture for 3 children

**Layer 2 (E, F, G, H, I, J):**
- Different parent groups coordinate independently
- E and F (A's children): coordinate together
- G (B's child): uses aperture from E-F coordination
- H, I, J (C's children): coordinate together

**Result:** ✅ Multi-level coordination works correctly

## Mathematical Formulation

### Aperture Calculation

For n children, base aperture angle:
```
α = atan((n-1) × s / 2 / d) × n

Where:
- s = minimum horizontal spacing (150px)
- d = vertical distance (150px)
- n = number of children
```

### Coordination Rule

For siblings S₁, S₂, ..., Sₘ at the same layer:
```
n_max = max(num_children(Sᵢ)) for all i

α_coordinated = atan((n_max-1) × s / 2 / d) × n_max

For all siblings Sᵢ:
    Sᵢ.aperture_angle = α_coordinated
```

### Position Calculation

Child position from parent:
```
θ_child = θ_parent + Δθ
x_child = x_parent + d × tan(θ_child)
y_child = y_parent + d

Where Δθ is the angular offset within parent's aperture
```

## Code Structure

### Enhanced TreeNode

```python
class TreeNode:
    aperture_angle: float  # Angular spread for MY children
    my_angle: float        # MY angle relative to parent
    x, y: float           # Cartesian position
    children: List        # Child nodes
    parent: Optional      # Parent node
```

### Key Methods

   - Applies coordinated aperture to all siblings

2. **`coordinate_siblings_aperture(parent)`** (NEW!)
   - Finds maximum children count among parent's children
   - Calculates coordinated aperture
   - Applies to all siblings

3. **`_position_subtree()`**
   - Distributes children within parent's aperture
   - Assigns angle to each child
   - Converts angle to position
   - Recursively positions subtrees

4. **`_position_reactions()`**
   - Positions transitions along angular paths

## Performance

- **Time:** O(V + E) - linear in pathway size
- **Space:** O(V) - one TreeNode per species
- **Coordination:** O(V) - one pass per layer

No performance impact from coordination rule.

## Comparison: Before and After Rule 4

### Before (No Coordination)

```
Each sibling independent:

       ROOT
      /    \
     A      B
    /|\     |        A spreads widely
   / | \    |        B stays narrow
  E  F  G   H        → Inconsistent!
```

**Problems:**
- Visual chaos
- Some branches cramped, others loose
- Hard to understand structure
- Unprofessional appearance

### After (With Coordination)

```
Siblings coordinate:

       ROOT
      /    \
     A      B         Both use same aperture
    /|\     |         Uniform appearance
   / | \    H         → Consistent!
  E  F  G
```

**Benefits:**
- Visual harmony
- Consistent spacing
- Clear structure
- Professional quality
