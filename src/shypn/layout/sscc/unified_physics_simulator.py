"""Unified Physics Simulator - Combines all forces for Solar System Layout.

VERSION: 2.2.3 - Fixed Hub Mass Threshold for Selective Weakening
DATE: October 17, 2025
STATUS: PRODUCTION STABLE

MAJOR FEATURES:
- Black hole galaxy model with SCC cycle at center
- SCC-aware gravitational attraction (only affects constellation hubs)
- Black hole damping wave (distance-based repulsion reduction)
- Arc force weakening for SCC connections (prevents ternary clustering)
- Black hole whirlwind effect (spiral orbital patterns)
- Pulsating singularity with stochastic dynamics ⭐ NEW in v2.2.0
- Variance-based convergence detection ⭐ NEW in v2.2.0
- Event horizon mechanics (configurable node trapping)
- Multi-level galaxy cluster hierarchies

PULSATING SINGULARITY INSIGHT (v2.2.0):
"The clogged sink drain pulses at high frequency from the bottom of the 
singularity to the surface, causing the damping wave oscillation, and the 
elements at surface (hubs, constellations, ...) are constantly under 
rearrangement in relation to each other."

SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION:
Based on real astrophysical phenomena:
- Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in black hole accretion disks
- Wave propagation from singularity to surface (100-1000 Hz)
- Stochastic thermodynamic equilibrium (Langevin dynamics)
- Fluctuation-dissipation theorem
- Dynamic equilibrium through constant micro-adjustments
- Optimal distribution via variance stabilization

The system never reaches static equilibrium - instead maintains dynamic
equilibrium through high-frequency pulsations, like molecules in a liquid
constantly rearranging while maintaining overall structure.

PHYSICS MODEL:
This simulator implements a unified physics model that combines:
1. Oscillatory forces (arc-based attraction/repulsion with equilibrium)
2. Proximity repulsion (all-pairs Coulomb-like repulsion with damping wave)
3. Ambient tension (global spacing force)
4. Hub group repulsion (prevents constellation clustering)
5. SCC cohesion (maintains black hole cycle shape)
6. SCC gravity (pulls constellation hubs toward black hole)
7. SCC whirlwind (tangential forces create spiral motion)
8. Pulsating singularity (high-frequency stochastic forces) ⭐ NEW
9. Variance tracking (convergence detection metric) ⭐ NEW

Key insight: Graph properties → Physics properties
- SCC nodes have super-massive mass (MASS_SCC_NODE = 1000) - Black hole
- Super hubs have massive mass (MASS_SUPER_HUB = 300) - Constellation hubs
- Major hubs have mass (MASS_MAJOR_HUB = 200)
- Minor hubs have mass (MASS_MINOR_HUB = 100)
- Places have mass (MASS_PLACE = 100) - Shared places/satellites
- Transitions have light mass (MASS_TRANSITION = 50)
- Everything attracts via arcs (oscillatory forces)
- Everything repels by proximity (prevents overlap/clustering)
- Ambient tension maintains global spacing
- Black hole damping wave reduces repulsion near SCC (allows tight packing)
- Arc weakening for SCC connections (90% reduction) prevents ternary systems

FORCE HIERARCHY (Current Calibration - 94% global reduction applied):
1. SCC Cohesion: 30,000 (maintains black hole cycle shape)
2. SCC Gravity: 300 (radial pull toward black hole, mass >= 1000)
3. SCC Whirlwind: 50 (tangential spiral force)
4. Pulsation Noise: 10 (stochastic forces, temperature-like) ⭐ NEW in v2.2.0
5. Hub Group Repulsion: 30 (prevents constellation clustering)
6. Arc Forces: 1.2 (attraction/repulsion via connections)
   - Normal arcs: 1.2
   - SCC arcs: 0.12 (90% weaker - prevents ternary clustering)
7. Proximity Repulsion: 6 (with black hole damping)
8. Damping Wave: 0.1-1.0 (distance-based from black hole center)

CONVERGENCE DETECTION:
- Position variance tracking (measures system stability)
- Variance stabilization indicates optimal distribution reached
- Like molecules in liquid: constant motion, stable structure

The algorithm automatically balances all forces to create natural,
stable layouts without user intervention. The pulsating singularity
ensures the system never freezes in suboptimal configurations.

CHANGELOG:
v2.2.3 (Oct 17, 2025): Fixed hub mass threshold (500→150) for selective weakening ⭐ CRITICAL FIX

    """Unified physics engine combining oscillatory, proximity, and ambient forces.
    
    VERSION: 2.1.0 - Black Hole Whirlwind Effect
    
    This is the core physics engine that makes the Solar System Layout work.
    It combines multiple force types to create stable, aesthetic layouts:
    
    1. Oscillatory Forces (arc-based):
       - Attractive when r > r_equilibrium (pulls nodes together)
       - Repulsive when r < r_equilibrium (pushes nodes apart)
       - Creates natural orbital patterns
       - Weighted by arc.weight
       - SCC arc weakening: 90% reduction to prevent ternary clustering
    
    2. Proximity Repulsion (all-pairs):
       - Always repulsive (prevents overlap)
       - Stronger for higher masses (hubs repel more)
       - Distance-dependent (1/r² falloff)
       - Creates hub separation
       - Black hole damping wave: reduced near SCC center
    
    3. Ambient Tension (global):
       - Weak repulsion between all nodes
       - Keeps network spread out
       - Prevents global clustering
       - Maintains minimum spacing
    
    4. Hub Group Repulsion:
       - Group-to-group repulsion between constellations
       - Prevents constellation clustering
       - Distance-based with combined masses
    
    5. SCC Cohesion:
       - Pulls SCC nodes toward centroid
       - Maintains black hole cycle shape
       - Strong force (30,000) with target radius
    
    6. SCC Gravity:
       - Attracts constellation hubs (mass >= 1000) to black hole
       - Creates orbital mechanics around SCC center
       - Does NOT affect satellites or shared places
    
    The combination of these forces creates layouts where:
    - SCCs become black hole gravitational centers
    - Constellation hubs spiral around the black hole (whirlwind!)
    - Pulsations cause constant micro-rearrangement (dynamic equilibrium) ⭐
    - Shared places orbit constellation hubs (not black hole)
    - Satellites orbit hubs naturally
    - Everything stays well-spaced with hierarchical structure
    - Beautiful spiral patterns emerge from whirlwind effect
    - System achieves optimal distribution through variance stabilization ⭐

            # ============================================================
            # SMART ARC WEAKENING: Only weaken hub-to-SCC arcs, not place-to-SCC
            # 
            # EVOLUTION:
            # v2.0.0: Weakened ALL arcs to SCC by 90%
            #   Problem: Places couldn't orbit cycle (arc too weak: 0.12)
            #   
            # v2.2.1: Fixed proximity repulsion (or→and)
            #   Problem: Places form ternary system (arc still too weak!)
            #   
            # v2.2.2: Selective weakening - but WRONG threshold (>= 500)
            #   Problem: Hubs have mass 200-300, so they got FULL strength too!
            #   Result: Still forming ternary system!
            #
            # v2.2.3: FIXED threshold - distinguish places from hubs
            #   Mass values: Place=100, MinorHub=200, MajorHub=200, SuperHub=300
            #   Threshold: 150 (between place and hub)
            #   Solution: Places (100) get FULL strength
            #            Hubs (200+) get WEAKENED strength
            #
            # LOGIC:
            # - If ONE node is SCC AND other mass < 150: FULL STRENGTH (place-to-cycle)
            # - If ONE node is SCC AND other mass >= 150: WEAKEN (hub-to-cycle)  
            # - If BOTH nodes NOT in SCC: FULL STRENGTH (hub-to-hub, place-to-hub)
            #
            # RESULT:
            # - Places (mass=100) orbit cycle closely (full arc: 1.2) ✓
            # - Hubs (mass=200-300) spread around cycle (weakened arc: 0.12) ✓

        Black hole creates a "gravity wave" that dampens repulsion forces.
        Nodes closer to black hole experience reduced repulsion (allows tighter packing).
        Nodes far from black hole experience full repulsion (normal spreading).
        
        Damping formula: d = 0.1 + 0.9 × (avg_distance / max_distance)²
        
        At r=0 (at black hole): damping = 0.1 (90% reduction - very tight!)
        At r=500: damping = 0.35 (65% reduction - moderate)
        At r=1000+: damping = 1.0 (no reduction - full repulsion)
        
        This creates natural gradient: tight near black hole, spread far away.
        
        Used by:

        ============================================================
        
        SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION:
        - Based on Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in black holes
        - Singularity pulses at high frequency (100-1000 Hz)
        - Waves propagate radially from center to surface
        - Creates stochastic Brownian motion (thermal fluctuations)
        
        IMPLEMENTATION:
        - Langevin dynamics: deterministic forces + stochastic noise
        - Gaussian random forces scaled by temperature parameter
        - Temperature decays over time (simulated annealing)
        - Prevents system from freezing in local minima
        
        PHYSICS INTERPRETATION:
        - Like molecules in liquid: constant motion, stable structure
        - Never static equilibrium - dynamic equilibrium instead
        - Optimal distribution through variance stabilization
        - High frequency ensures constant rearrangement
        
        FORCE EQUATION:
        F_pulsation = N(0, σ²) × temperature × sqrt(node_mass)
        
        Where:
        - N(0, σ²) = Gaussian random variable
        - temperature = current pulsation strength (decays over time)
        - sqrt(mass) = mass-dependent scaling (heavier nodes more stable)

        CONVERGENCE METRIC:
        Variance measures spread of positions around centroid.

        SCIENTIFIC BASIS:
        - Statistical mechanics: free energy minimization
        - Thermodynamics: equilibrium through entropy maximization
        - Variance = measure of system disorder/energy
        
        INTERPRETATION:
        - High variance change: system actively rearranging
        - Low variance change: system reached equilibrium
        - Stabilized variance: optimal distribution achieved
        
        Like water in a glass:
        - Initially: molecules moving wildly (high variance change)
        - Eventually: gentle motion, stable structure (low variance change)
        - Equilibrium: constant small fluctuations, but variance stable
