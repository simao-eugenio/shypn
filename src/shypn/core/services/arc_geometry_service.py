"""Arc geometry service for parallel arc detection and offset calculation.

This module provides stateless functions for managing arc geometry,
particularly for handling parallel arcs (multiple arcs between same nodes).

Parallel arcs occur when:
- Same direction: Multiple arcs from A → B
- Opposite direction: Arcs in both directions (A → B and B → A)

These arcs need visual offsets to avoid overlapping and maintain clarity.
