    Attributes:
        coordinate_scale: Factor to scale KEGG coordinates (default: 2.5)
            KEGG uses small coordinate values, so scaling improves visibility
        
        include_cofactors: Include common cofactors (ATP, NADH, etc.) (default: True)
            When False, filters out ubiquitous metabolites to reduce clutter
        
        split_reversible: Split reversible reactions into two transitions (default: False)
            When True, creates forward and backward transitions for reversible reactions
        
        add_initial_marking: Add initial tokens to places (default: True)
            When True, adds one token to each place for immediate simulation/testing
            KEGG pathways don't specify initial states, so this enables quick experimentation
        
        filter_isolated_compounds: Remove compounds not involved in any reaction (default: True)
            When True, excludes compounds that appear in KEGG but aren't connected to reactions
            This significantly reduces model size and clutter (typically removes 15-30% of compounds)
        
        enhance_kinetics: Apply heuristic kinetics enhancement to transitions (default: True)
            When True, analyzes reaction structure to assign appropriate kinetic types
            (stochastic vs continuous) and reasonable parameter defaults
            Uses the heuristic system to fill gaps since KEGG lacks explicit kinetic data
        
        create_enzyme_places: Create explicit places for enzyme entries (default: False)
            When True, creates places for gene/enzyme/ortholog entries and test arcs (Biological PN)
            When False, enzymes remain implicit (cleaner layout, classical PN, matches original KEGG visualization)
            Recommendation: Set True for biological analysis, False for visual clarity
        
        center_x: X coordinate offset for positioning (default: 0.0)
        center_y: Y coordinate offset for positioning (default: 0.0)
        initial_tokens: Number of tokens to add to each place when add_initial_marking is True (default: 1)
