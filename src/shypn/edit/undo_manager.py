Undo/Redo Manager

This module provides the UndoManager class that:
1. Manages undo/redo stacks
2. Provides push/undo/redo operations
3. Notifies listeners of state changes
4. Enforces stack size limits

The UndoManager is instantiated in ModelCanvasManager and used throughout
the application to record and execute undo/redo operations.
