Force-Directed Layout Algorithm (Fruchterman-Reingold)

Implements physics-based layout for complex networks.
Best for highly interconnected pathways without clear hierarchy.

Based on:
    Fruchterman & Reingold (1991) - "Graph drawing by force-directed 
    placement" Software: Practice and Experience
    
Algorithm:
    - Treats nodes as charged particles (repel each other)
    - Treats edges as springs (pull connected nodes together)
    - Simulates until system reaches equilibrium (energy minimum)
    - Uses NetworkX spring_layout implementation

        PHYSICS MODEL:
        
        1. UNIVERSAL REPULSION (ALL mass nodes):
           - Every place repels every other place
           - Every transition repels every other transition
           - Every place repels every transition
           - Force: F_repulsion = -k² / distance
           - Prevents overlap, creates spacing
        
        2. SELECTIVE ATTRACTION (only via springs/arcs):
           - Springs (arcs) pull connected mass nodes together
           - Force: F_spring = k × distance × spring_strength
           - Spring strength = arc weight (stoichiometry)
           - Example: 2A + B → C means A has 2× stronger spring to reaction
        
        3. EQUILIBRIUM:
           - System converges when forces balance on each mass node
           - Connected nodes: pulled together by spring, pushed apart by repulsion
           - Disconnected nodes: only repulsion, pushed to maximum separation
