"""
Tree-Based Hierarchical Layout - Simple Binary Tree Approach

Treats biochemical pathways as trees/forests where:
- Each species is a node
- Each reaction creates edges between nodes
- Children are positioned directly below parents
- Siblings spread horizontally with fixed spacing

Algorithm:
1. Build tree structure (identify roots, branches, leaves)
2. Position nodes vertically (parent â†’ child)
3. Spread siblings horizontally with equal spacing
4. Center each parent above its children

This creates clean vertical layouts where:
- Single chains stay vertical (same X coordinate)
- Branching spreads horizontally with fixed spacing
- Tree grows straight down (no oblique angles)
- Simple and predictable structure

Coordinate System:
- Conceptually: Cartesian coordinates with origin at lower-left, Y grows upward
- Implementation: Graphics coordinates with origin at top-left, Y grows downward
- See doc/COORDINATE_SYSTEM.md for complete details
- In this file: Y increases = visual descent = pathway progression
