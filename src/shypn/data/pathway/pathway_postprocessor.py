Pathway Post-Processor (Simplified v2.0)

Minimal post-processing for SBML pathways:
- Arbitrary position assignment (force-directed layout will recalculate via Swiss Palette)
- Color assignment by compartment
- Unit normalization (concentrations → token counts)
- Name resolution (IDs → readable names)

NO LAYOUT ALGORITHMS - Layout is now user-initiated via Swiss Palette → Force-Directed

Architecture:
- BaseProcessor: Abstract base for all processors
- ColorProcessor: Assigns colors by compartment
- UnitNormalizer: Converts concentrations to tokens
- NameResolver: Resolves display names
- CompartmentGrouper: Groups species by compartment
- PathwayPostProcessor: Minimal coordinator
