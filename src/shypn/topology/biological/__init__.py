"""Biological topology analyzers for Biological Petri Nets.

Provides specialized analyzers for biological pathway models that understand:
- Test arcs (catalysts/enzymes)
- Convergent production (multiple pathways â†’ same metabolite)
- Regulatory dependencies (shared catalysts)
- Refined locality theory (Strong vs Weak Independence)
