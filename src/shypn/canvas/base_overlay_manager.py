"""Base Overlay Manager - Abstract base class for canvas overlay management.

This module defines the abstract interface for managing overlay widgets on a canvas.
Overlays include palettes, toolbars, and other UI elements that appear on top of
the drawing canvas.

Design Principles:
- Single Responsibility: Only manages overlay widgets, not canvas logic
- Open/Closed: Open for extension (subclassing), closed for modification
- Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions (ABC), not concrete implementations
