"""Locality Detector - Detect transition neighborhoods (Place-Transition-Place).

This module provides the LocalityDetector class for identifying localities
in Petri nets based on arc connectivity.

Locality Concept (from legacy shypnpy):
    "Place-transition-place defines what is called a Locality"
    
    A locality is: Input Places → Transition → Output Places
    
    Each locality has exactly ONE central transition, but places can be
    shared between multiple localities (organic system structure).

Example:
    detector = LocalityDetector(model)
    locality = detector.get_locality_for_transition(transition)
    
    if locality.is_valid:
        print(f"Locality: {locality.get_summary()}")
        print(f"Input places: {[p.name for p in locality.input_places]}")
        print(f"Output places: {[p.name for p in locality.output_places]}")
