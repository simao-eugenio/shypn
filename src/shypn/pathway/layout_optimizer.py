    """Optimize layout to reduce overlaps.
    
    Uses force-directed algorithm to push apart overlapping elements
    while maintaining attraction to original positions (from pathway image).
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Store original positions for each element
    2. Build spatial grid for efficient overlap detection
    3. For each iteration:
       a. Detect overlapping pairs using spatial grid
       b. Calculate repulsive forces between overlapping elements
       c. Calculate attractive forces to original positions
       d. Apply forces to update positions
       e. Check convergence (max movement < threshold)
    4. Stop when converged or max iterations reached
