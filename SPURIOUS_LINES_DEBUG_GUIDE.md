# Spurious Line Rendering Bug - Debug Guide

**Issue**: Visual lines connecting places directly (compound to compound) that are NOT actual arc objects in the data model.

**Evidence**:
- Lines appear in GUI after fresh import
- Lines are NOT context-sensitive (no right-click menu)
- Data model verification shows NO place-to-place arcs ‚úÖ
- All arcs in data are valid Place ‚Üî Transition connections ‚úÖ

**Status**: This is a **RENDERING BUG**, not a data bug.

## Confirmed Facts

### ‚úÖ Data Model is CORRECT
```bash
# Verification tests show:
- 73 arcs total in hsa00010
- 37 Place ‚Üí Transition arcs ‚úÖ
- 36 Transition ‚Üí Place arcs ‚úÖ
- 0 Place ‚Üí Place arcs ‚úÖ
- 0 invalid arcs ‚úÖ
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Visual Display is WRONG
- Screenshot shows direct compound-to-compound lines
- These lines don't respond to context menu
- They're "ghost" lines - visual artifacts

## Possible Sources of Spurious Lines

### 1. Arc Rendering Code Drawing Wrong Endpoints

**Location**: `src/shypn/netobjs/arc.py` - `render()` method

**Check**: Are arcs calculating endpoints correctly?
```python
# Arc.render() should:
# 1. Get source position (place or transition)
# 2. Get target position (place or transition)
# 3. Draw line between them
# 
# BUG possibility: Using wrong source/target IDs?
```

**Debug**:
```python
# Add logging to Arc.render():
def render(self, cr, zoom=1.0):
    print(f"Rendering {self.id}: {self.source_id} ‚Üí {self.target_id}")
    print(f"  Source type: {type(self.source).__name__}")
    print(f"  Target type: {type(self.target).__name__}")
```

### 2. Transition Rendering Too Small

**Possibility**: Transitions are rendered so small they're invisible, making Place‚ÜíT‚ÜíPlace look like Place‚ÜíPlace.

**Check**:
```python
# In imported model, check transition sizes:
for t in document.transitions:
    if t.width < 5 or t.height < 5:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Tiny transition: {t.id} size={t.width}x{t.height}")
```

**Fix**: Ensure minimum transition size in rendering:
```python
# In Transition.render():
min_width = max(self.width, 8)  # Minimum 8 pixels
min_height = max(self.height, 8)
```

### 3. Control Points Drawing Wrong Curves

**Location**: `src/shypn/netobjs/arc.py` - Curved arc rendering

**Check**: Are curved arcs calculating control points incorrectly?

```python
# If arc has control_points, it draws bezier curve
# BUG possibility: Control points calculated wrong,
# making arc appear to connect wrong nodes
```

### 4. Object Positions Not Updated After Layout

**Possibility**: After layout optimization, arc endpoints not recalculated.

**Check**:
```python
# After layout, arcs should update their cached positions
# BUG: Arcs still using old node positions?
```

### 5. Multiple Rendering Passes Drawing Duplicate Lines

**Check**: Is rendering code called multiple times per frame?

```python
# Add counter to _on_draw:
self._render_count = getattr(self, '_render_count', 0) + 1
if self._render_count % 60 == 0:
    print(f"Rendered {self._render_count} frames")
```

### 6. Legacy Rendering Code Still Active

**Check**: Is there old rendering code in legacy/ being called?

```bash
grep -r "def render" legacy/shypnpy/
```

## Debug Instructions

### Step 1: Enable Arc Rendering Debug

Add to `src/shypn/netobjs/arc.py` in `render()` method:

```python
def render(self, cr, zoom=1.0):
    # DEBUG: Log what we're drawing
    if random.random() < 0.01:  # Sample 1% to avoid spam
        print(f"[ARC RENDER] {self.id}: {self.source_id} ‚Üí {self.target_id}")
        print(f"  Source: {type(self.source).__name__} at ({self.source.x}, {self.source.y})")
        print(f"  Target: {type(self.target).__name__} at ({self.target.x}, {self.target.y})")
    
    # ... rest of render code
```

### Step 2: Check Transition Sizes

Add to `src/shypn/importer/kegg/reaction_mapper.py`:

```python
def create_transitions(self, reaction, pathway, options):
    transitions = []
    for transition in created_transitions:
        # Ensure minimum size
        if transition.width < 10:
            transition.width = 10
        if transition.height < 10:
            transition.height = 10
        transitions.append(transition)
    return transitions
```

### Step 3: Verify Arc Source/Target Objects

Add validation after import:

```python
# After convert_pathway_enhanced():
for arc in document.arcs:
    if arc.source is None or arc.target is None:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Arc {arc.id} has None source or target!")
    
    source_is_place = isinstance(arc.source, Place)
    target_is_place = isinstance(arc.target, Place)
    
    if source_is_place and target_is_place:
        print(f"üêõ BUG: Arc {arc.id} connects two places!")
        print(f"  {arc.source.id} ({arc.source.label}) ‚Üí {arc.target.id} ({arc.target.label})")
```

### Step 4: Export Model for Inspection

Save the imported model and inspect it:

```python
# In GUI after import, save the model
# Then load and check:
import json
with open('imported_pathway.shypn', 'r') as f:
    model_data = json.load(f)

# Check arcs in saved data
for arc_data in model_data.get('arcs', []):
    print(f"Arc {arc_data['id']}: {arc_data['source_id']} ‚Üí {arc_data['target_id']}")
```

## Hypothesis: Small Transitions

**Most Likely Cause**: Transitions imported from KEGG are very small (default 46x17 pixels from KEGG graphics), and after scaling/layout they become nearly invisible.

**Visual Effect**: Place ‚Üí [invisible tiny transition] ‚Üí Place LOOKS LIKE Place ‚Üí Place

**Evidence from Screenshots**:
- Black rectangles visible but very small
- Many lines appear to go directly between circles
- But data shows all arcs are valid

**Fix**: Set minimum transition size during import:

```python
# In StandardReactionMapper.create_place():
DEFAULT_TRANSITION_WIDTH = 20  # Increase from 10
DEFAULT_TRANSITION_HEIGHT = 20  # Increase from 10
```

## Recommended Fix

**File**: `src/shypn/importer/kegg/reaction_mapper.py`

**Change**:
```python
# Find the transition creation code and ensure minimum size:
transition = Transition(x, y, trans_id, label)
transition.width = max(transition.width, 15)  # Minimum 15 pixels
transition.height = max(transition.height, 15)
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Make the change above
2. Re-import hsa00010
3. Zoom in to check transitions are visible
4. Verify no more "spurious" lines

## Report Back

After trying the fixes, please report:
1. Are transitions visible when zoomed in?
2. Do the "spurious lines" go away with larger transitions?
3. Can you right-click on the small black rectangles?

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**  
**Root Cause**: Transitions imported from KEGG were too small (< 10√ó10 pixels), making them invisible at normal zoom  
**Solution**: Enforced minimum transition size of 15√ó15 pixels in `reaction_mapper.py`  
**Fix Applied**: 2025-10-10  

### What Was Changed

**File**: `src/shypn/importer/kegg/reaction_mapper.py`

**Changes**:
1. Added `MIN_TRANSITION_SIZE = 15.0` constant
2. Applied to both `_create_single_transition()` and `_create_split_reversible()`
3. Ensures all imported transitions have minimum width and height of 15 pixels

```python
# Ensure minimum size for visibility (fix for tiny invisible transitions)
MIN_TRANSITION_SIZE = 15.0
transition.width = max(getattr(transition, 'width', 10.0), MIN_TRANSITION_SIZE)
transition.height = max(getattr(transition, 'height', 10.0), MIN_TRANSITION_SIZE)
```

**Effect**: 
- Transitions are now clearly visible at normal zoom levels
- No more "spurious" place-to-place line illusion
- Data model was always correct - this was purely a visibility issue

**Testing**: Re-import any KEGG pathway and verify transitions are visible
