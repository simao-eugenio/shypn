- Cleaned can_fire() and fire() methods
- Kept essential error handling

**KEGG Importer** (35 lines removed)
- `api_client.py`: Removed verbose API call logging
- `kgml_parser.py`: Removed parsing status prints

- Redirected errors to stderr

**Edit Operations** (37 lines removed)
- `undo_manager.py`: Cleaned operation tracking prints
- `edit_operations.py`: Removed clipboard operation prints
- `snapshots.py`: Removed warning prints
- Removed palette debug output

**UI Components** (44 lines removed)
- `model_canvas_loader.py`: Removed mode switching prints
- Palette managers: Cleaned initialization prints

**Other Modules** (47 lines removed)
- Lasso selector, tools/operations palettes
- Helper modules
- `workspace_settings.py`: Warning messages to stderr

**Total Impact:** 244 deletions across 25 files

**Result:**
- âœ… Cleaner console output during normal operation
- âœ… Error messages preserved (redirected to stderr)
- âœ… No functional changes - all features still work
- âœ… Application tested and runs without errors

## Next Steps (For Tomorrow)

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Complete Pathway Editing Research Implementation** ðŸŽ¯
   - Review `DUAL_EDITING_MODES_PLAN.md` (7 phases, 16-20 days)
   - Start **Phase 1: Mode Management Infrastructure** (2 days)
     - Create mode enum (CREATE vs PATHWAY_EDIT)
     - Add mode property to ModelCanvasManager
     - Implement mode switching logic
     - Create visual indicator system

2. **Pathway Editing Features** ðŸ”¬
   - Implement hierarchical visualization (from research)
   - Add source/sink abstraction mechanisms
   - Integrate graph layout algorithms (Sugiyama, Fruchterman-Reingold)
   - Apply centrality analysis for node importance

3. **Test KEGG Import End-to-End** âœ“
   - Currently marked as in-progress in TODO list
   - Test complete workflow: fetch â†’ preview â†’ import
   - Verify panel behavior (dock/float/close)
   - Document any issues found

4. **Metadata Preservation** ðŸ“Š
   - Store KEGG IDs in Place/Transition metadata
   - Preserve enzyme names, compound names
   - Enable future linking back to KEGG database

5. **User Documentation** ðŸ“–
   - Create `KEGG_IMPORT_USER_GUIDE.md` in `doc/pathways/`
   - Add screenshots of UI workflow
   - Document mapping rules and limitations
   - Add usage examples

### Long-term Goals

**Visual Guidance System** (from dual editing modes plan)
- Color coding for hierarchy levels
- Visual overlays for edit modes
- Keyboard shortcuts (H/G/M/F)
- Status bar indicators

**Advanced Features**
- Pathway refinement tools
- Centrality-based node importance
- Source/sink visualization
- Graph layout customization

---

## Research Foundation

### Documents Created
1. **PATHWAY_EDITING_RESEARCH.md** (20+ pages)
   - Hierarchical visualization algorithms
   - Source/sink abstraction
   - 4 graph layout algorithms
   - 13+ peer-reviewed references

2. **DUAL_EDITING_MODES_PLAN.md**
   - CREATE MODE vs PATHWAY EDIT MODE
   - 7-phase implementation roadmap
   - Visual guidance system design

3. **Supporting Documentation**
   - PATHWAY_EDITING_SUMMARY.md
   - DUAL_EDITING_MODES_COMPARISON.md

## Notes for Tomorrow

### Remember to:
- [ ] Review the dual editing modes plan before starting
- [ ] Check if any KEGG import issues were discovered during testing
- [ ] Consider creating a development branch for pathway editing features
- [ ] Update TODO list as phases are completed

### Context for Next Session:
- All debug prints removed and code is clean
- Documentation is well-organized and easy to navigate
- Scientific research foundation is solid (13+ papers referenced)
- Implementation roadmap is detailed and ready to follow
