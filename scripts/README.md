## Development Tools

These scripts are designed for:
- **Development**: Quick model inspection and manipulation
- **Testing**: Headless test execution and model preparation
- **Analysis**: KEGG pathway analysis and topology comparison
- **Debugging**: Transition type validation and model inspection
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing without GUI requirements

## Related Directories

- `tests/`: Complete test suite (130+ test files, organized November 2025)
- `archive/`: Legacy analysis scripts (deprecated)
- `src/shypn/dev/`: Development utilities integrated into the application
- `src/shypn/diagnostic/`: Diagnostic tools for runtime debugging

## Notes

- All scripts assume they are run from the repository root
- Some scripts require specific data files or model files as arguments
- Scripts use the same Python environment as the main application
- For KEGG-related scripts, ensure KEGG data is available in `data/` directory

## Migration from Root (November 2025)

These scripts were moved from the repository root to `scripts/` in November 2025 as part of project organization improvements. They maintain 100% functionality with the same command-line interfaces.
