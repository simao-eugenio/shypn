"""Ask user to provide the file path to analyze the actual model."""

print("""
To analyze the model shown in your screenshot, please:

1. Save the current model if you haven't (File â†’ Save)
2. Provide the file path to the saved .shypn file

Or tell me:
- Which pathway did you import? (e.g., hsa00010)
- Did you use the GUI import or load a saved file?
- Can you export and send me the model file?

I need to see the actual DocumentModel to verify if:
a) Place-to-place arcs exist in the data (BUG!)
b) Transitions are too small to see (VISUAL ISSUE)
c) This is from an old file with legacy conversion (LEGACY)

Based on the screenshot, I can see compound IDs like:
- C01159, C00236, C00085, C00074, C00236, C15973
- Gene/enzyme labels like: PCK1, FBP1, BPGM, MINPP1, PKLR, LDHAL6A, ALDH3A1

This looks like Glycolysis or Pyruvate metabolism pathway.
