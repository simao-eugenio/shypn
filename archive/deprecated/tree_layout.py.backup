"""
Tree-Based Hierarchical Layout - Simple Binary Tree Approach

Treats biochemical pathways as trees/forests where:
- Each species is a node
- Each reaction creates edges between nodes
- Children are positioned directly below parents
- Siblings spread horizontally with fixed spacing

Algorithm:
1. Build tree structure (identify roots, branches, leaves)
2. Position nodes vertically (parent → child)
3. Spread siblings horizontally with equal spacing
4. Center each parent above its children

This creates clean vertical layouts where:
- Single chains stay vertical (same X coordinate)
- Branching spreads horizontally with fixed spacing
- Tree grows straight down (no oblique angles)
- Simple and predictable structure

Coordinate System:
- Conceptually: Cartesian coordinates with origin at lower-left, Y grows upward
- Implementation: Graphics coordinates with origin at top-left, Y grows downward
- See doc/COORDINATE_SYSTEM.md for complete details
- In this file: Y increases = visual descent = pathway progression
