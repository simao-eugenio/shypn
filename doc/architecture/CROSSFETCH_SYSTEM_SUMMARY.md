# Cross-Fetch Information Enrichment System - Summary

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PLANNING COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

---

## Overview

The **Cross-Fetch System** is a comprehensive multi-source pathway enrichment architecture that automatically aggregates data from multiple authoritative databases to create the most complete and accurate pathway representations possible.

### Core Concept

> **"A Shypn pathway is a composition of several reliable sources of information, with quality-based voting to select the best data ever and logged."**

When importing a pathway (e.g., from SBML), the system:
1. âœ… Identifies missing or incomplete information
2. âœ… Queries multiple authoritative sources in parallel
3. âœ… Scores quality of each source's data
4. âœ… Resolves conflicts using intelligent voting
5. âœ… Merges best data with full attribution
6. âœ… Logs all sources and quality metrics

## Information Types Enriched

| Type | Examples | Primary Sources | Quality Threshold |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Coordinates** | (x, y) positions | KEGG, Reactome, WikiPathways | 0.3 |
| **Concentrations** | Initial markings | BioModels, SABIO-RK | 0.5 |

---

## Quality Scoring System

### Score Calculation

```python
Quality Score = (
    0.25 Ã— Completeness +           # % of fields populated
    0.30 Ã— Source Reliability +     # Database reputation
    0.20 Ã— Internal Consistency +   # Data validation
    0.25 Ã— Validation Status        # Experimental proof
)
```

### Source Reliability Ratings

| Source | Reliability | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| BioModels | 1.00 | Curated, peer-reviewed, validated |
| Reactome | 0.95 | Expert-curated by pathway specialists |
| UniProt | 0.95 | Expert-curated protein database |
| ChEBI | 0.95 | Expert-curated chemical database |
| SABIO-RK | 0.90 | Kinetic data specialist |
| KEGG | 0.85 | Comprehensive, mostly auto-generated |
| WikiPathways | 0.80 | Community-curated |
| PubChem | 0.75 | Large scale, variable quality |
| Predicted | 0.30 | Computational predictions |

---

## Voting & Conflict Resolution

### Strategies

1. **Quality Weighted** (default)
   - Selects source with highest quality score
   - Fast, reliable for most cases

2. **Source Priority**
   - Follows predefined source ranking
   - Used for critical data (kinetics, stoichiometry)

3. **Consensus**
   - Requires 2+ sources to agree
   - High confidence for concentrations

4. **Merge Complementary**
   - Combines non-conflicting data
   - Best for annotations and metadata

### Strategy Selection by Data Type

```python
VOTING_STRATEGIES = {
    'coordinates': 'quality_weighted',    # Best layout
    'concentrations': 'consensus',        # Must agree
    'kinetics': 'source_priority',        # Trust experts
    'annotations': 'merge',               # Combine all
}
```
