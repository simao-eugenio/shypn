# Graph Layout DeepCopy Fix - GObject Descendant Issue

## Date
October 15, 2025

## Issue Summary

**ERROR**: `TypeError: GObject descendants' instances are non-copyable`

### Stack Trace Location
```python
File "/home/simao/projetos/shypn/src/shypn/edit/graph_layout/force_directed.py", line 107
    undirected_graph = graph.to_undirected()
    
File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/networkx/classes/digraph.py", line 1243
    G.add_edges_from((u, v, deepcopy(d)) ...)
    
File "/usr/lib/python3.12/copy.py", line 226
    return type(x)(x.__func__, deepcopy(x.__self__, memo))
    
TypeError: GObject descendants' instances are non-copyable
```

### Symptoms
- Graph layout algorithms fail when applied
- Error occurs during force-directed layout
- NetworkX `to_undirected()` triggers the issue
- Only happens with GTK/GObject-based applications

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

**NetworkX's `to_undirected()` method uses `deepcopy()`** on all edge data when converting a directed graph to undirected. This is problematic because:

1. **Graph structure** in `engine.py`:
   ```python
   # Nodes are the actual Place/Transition objects (which may contain GObject refs)
   graph.add_node(place, type='place')
   
   # Edges stored the arc object (WRONG!)
   graph.add_edge(source_obj, target_obj, weight=weight, obj=arc)  # ‚Üê Problem!
   ```

2. **Conversion attempt** in `force_directed.py`:
   ```python
   undirected_graph = graph.to_undirected()  # ‚Üê Calls deepcopy()
   ```

3. **What goes wrong**:
   - NetworkX tries to `deepcopy()` edge data dictionary: `{'weight': 1.0, 'obj': <Arc>}`
   - Arc objects contain GTK/GObject references (for rendering, callbacks, etc.)
   - Python's `deepcopy()` fails on GObject descendants
   - Error: "GObject descendants' instances are non-copyable"

### Why This Matters for Force-Directed Layout

**Physics requirement**: Force-directed layouts need **universal repulsion** between ALL nodes:
- **DiGraph (directed)**: Only connected nodes interact ‚Üí places don't repel other places ‚ùå
- **Graph (undirected)**: ALL nodes repel ALL other nodes ‚Üí correct physics ‚úì

**We must convert** DiGraph ‚Üí Graph for proper layout, but `to_undirected()` uses deepcopy!

## The Solution

### Two-Part Fix

#### Part 1: Remove Arc Objects from Edge Data

**File**: `src/shypn/edit/graph_layout/engine.py` (line ~154)

**Before**:
```python
if source_obj in graph and target_obj in graph:
    graph.add_edge(source_obj, target_obj, weight=weight, obj=arc)  # ‚Üê Stores arc object
    arcs_added += 1
```

**After**:
```python
if source_obj in graph and target_obj in graph:
    # Don't store arc object - it contains GObject references that can't be deepcopied
    # Just store the weight (stoichiometry) which is all we need for layout
    graph.add_edge(source_obj, target_obj, weight=weight)  # ‚Üê Only store weight
    arcs_added += 1
```

**Rationale**: 
- Layout algorithms only need edge **weights** (stoichiometry)
- Arc objects not needed for layout computation
- Removes GObject references from graph data

#### Part 2: Manual Graph Conversion (Avoid deepcopy)

**File**: `src/shypn/edit/graph_layout/force_directed.py` (line ~107)

**Before**:
```python
if isinstance(graph, nx.DiGraph):
    undirected_graph = graph.to_undirected()  # ‚Üê Uses deepcopy internally
    print(f"üî¨ Force-directed: ‚úì Converted DiGraph ‚Üí Graph")
```

**After**:
```python
if isinstance(graph, nx.DiGraph):
    # Manually convert to undirected to avoid deepcopy issues with GObject references
    # NetworkX's to_undirected() uses deepcopy which fails on GObject descendants
    undirected_graph = nx.Graph()
    
    # Copy nodes with their attributes (type='place' or 'transition')
    for node, data in graph.nodes(data=True):
        undirected_graph.add_node(node, **data)
    
    # Copy edges with their weights (no deepcopy, just reference)
    for u, v, data in graph.edges(data=True):
        weight = data.get('weight', 1.0)
        undirected_graph.add_edge(u, v, weight=weight)
    
    print(f"üî¨ Force-directed: ‚úì Converted DiGraph ‚Üí Graph for universal repulsion")
```

**Rationale**:
- Avoids NetworkX's built-in `deepcopy()` mechanism
- Manually creates undirected graph with shallow copy of data
- Preserves essential attributes (node type, edge weight)
- No copying of object references

## Technical Details

### What Gets Stored in the Graph

**Nodes (unchanged)**:
```python
# Node ID: The actual Place/Transition object
# Node data: Simple dict with type string
graph.add_node(place, type='place')
graph.add_node(transition, type='transition')
```

**Edges (fixed)**:
```python
# Before: Edge data = {'weight': float, 'obj': Arc}  ‚Üê Contains GObject!
# After:  Edge data = {'weight': float}  ‚Üê Only primitive data
```

### Manual Conversion Process

```python
# 1. Create empty undirected graph
undirected_graph = nx.Graph()

# 2. Copy nodes (shallow copy of data dict)
for node, data in graph.nodes(data=True):
    # node = Place/Transition object (reused, not copied)
    # data = {'type': 'place'} (new dict, but string is immutable)
    undirected_graph.add_node(node, **data)

# 3. Copy edges (extract weight only)
for u, v, data in graph.edges(data=True):
    # u, v = Place/Transition objects (reused)
    # data = {'weight': 1.0} (no arc object anymore!)
    weight = data.get('weight', 1.0)
    undirected_graph.add_edge(u, v, weight=weight)
```

**Key insight**: We're not copying the Place/Transition objects themselves, just reusing the same object references. Only the metadata dictionaries are new.

## Why This Fix Works

### Avoiding deepcopy

**NetworkX's `to_undirected()` implementation**:
```python
def to_undirected(self):
    G = Graph()
    G.add_nodes_from((n, deepcopy(d)) for n, d in self._node.items())  # ‚Üê deepcopy!
    G.add_edges_from((u, v, deepcopy(d)) for u, v, d in self.edges(data=True))  # ‚Üê deepcopy!
    return G
```

**Our manual implementation**:
```python
undirected_graph = nx.Graph()
for node, data in graph.nodes(data=True):
    undirected_graph.add_node(node, **data)  # ‚Üê No deepcopy, just dict unpacking
for u, v, data in graph.edges(data=True):
    undirected_graph.add_edge(u, v, weight=data.get('weight', 1.0))  # ‚Üê Explicit weight
```

### What We Preserve

‚úÖ **Node identities**: Same Place/Transition objects used as node IDs
‚úÖ **Node types**: `type='place'` or `type='transition'` attributes maintained
‚úÖ **Edge weights**: Stoichiometry values preserved for spring forces
‚úÖ **Graph structure**: All connections maintained, just undirected now

### What We Avoid

‚ùå **No GObject references**: Removed `obj=arc` from edge data
‚ùå **No deepcopy**: Manual iteration instead of `to_undirected()`
‚ùå **No complex objects**: Only primitive types (strings, floats) in metadata

## Impact Assessment

### Severity: HIGH
- **Scope**: All graph layout algorithms that convert to undirected
- **User Impact**: Layout features completely broken
- **Workaround**: None (layouts failed entirely)

### Fixed Algorithms
- ‚úÖ Force-directed (Fruchterman-Reingold)
- ‚úÖ Any other layout that converts to undirected

### No Impact On
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical layouts (don't need conversion)
- ‚úÖ Circular layouts (work with directed graphs)
- ‚úÖ Orthogonal layouts (handle directed graphs)

## Testing Verification

### Test Cases

1. **Force-Directed Layout**:
   - Create/import model with places and transitions
   - Apply force-directed layout
   - **VERIFY**: Layout completes without error ‚úì
   - **VERIFY**: Nodes positioned correctly ‚úì

2. **Large Models**:
   - Import SBML model (50+ nodes)
   - Apply force-directed layout
   - **VERIFY**: No deepcopy error ‚úì
   - **VERIFY**: Layout converges ‚úì

3. **Multiple Layout Calls**:
   - Apply layout multiple times
   - **VERIFY**: No memory issues ‚úì
   - **VERIFY**: Consistent behavior ‚úì

### Expected Behavior

**Before Fix**:
```
User clicks "Auto Layout"
  ‚Üí Build graph with arc objects
  ‚Üí Convert to undirected (calls deepcopy)
  ‚Üí TypeError: GObject descendants' instances are non-copyable ‚ùå
  ‚Üí Layout fails
```

**After Fix**:
```
User clicks "Auto Layout"
  ‚Üí Build graph (weight only, no arc objects)
  ‚Üí Manual conversion to undirected (no deepcopy)
  ‚Üí Layout algorithm runs ‚úì
  ‚Üí Positions computed ‚úì
  ‚Üí Nodes repositioned ‚úì
```

## Design Patterns

### Principle: Separation of Concerns

**Graph representation should contain**:
- ‚úÖ Node identities (object references)
- ‚úÖ Node metadata (simple types: strings, numbers)
- ‚úÖ Edge metadata (simple types: weights)

**Graph representation should NOT contain**:
- ‚ùå Full object state (GObject instances)
- ‚ùå Callbacks or methods
- ‚ùå UI-specific data

**Why**: Layout algorithms are mathematical operations on graph structure. They don't need full object state.

### Principle: Data vs References

**Two ways to use objects in graphs**:

1. **As node IDs** (our approach):
   ```python
   graph.add_node(place_object, type='place')  # Object is the ID
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Direct lookup: `positions[place_object]`
   - ‚úÖ No ID collisions
   - ‚úÖ Works with shallow operations

2. **As node data** (problematic):
   ```python
   graph.add_node(place_id, obj=place_object)  # Object is data
   ```
   - ‚ùå Requires deepcopy for graph operations
   - ‚ùå Fails with GObject descendants

**We use approach #1**, which avoids the deepcopy issue entirely for node identities.

## Code Quality

### Files Modified

1. **`src/shypn/edit/graph_layout/engine.py`**:
   - Line ~154: Removed `obj=arc` from `add_edge()`
   - Added explanatory comment

2. **`src/shypn/edit/graph_layout/force_directed.py`**:
   - Lines ~107-120: Replaced `to_undirected()` with manual conversion
   - Added detailed comments explaining the fix

### Documentation

- All changes have inline comments explaining rationale
- Comments reference GObject limitation
- Code is self-documenting

### Error Handling

No additional error handling needed because:
- Manual conversion is safe (no deepcopy to fail)
- Node/edge iteration is standard Python
- NetworkX Graph() construction is reliable

## Lessons Learned

### GObject Integration Challenges

**Problem**: GObject is a C-based object system with Python bindings
- GObject instances can't be pickled (serialized)
- GObject instances can't be deepcopied
- GObject instances can't be forked
- Limitation applies to GTK widgets and related objects

**Solution**: Keep GObject instances as references, never copy them
- Use objects as dictionary keys ‚úì
- Use objects as list elements ‚úì
- Pass objects as parameters ‚úì
- Store objects in object data ‚ùå (if that data will be copied)

### NetworkX Best Practices

**When using NetworkX with complex objects**:
1. Use objects as node IDs, not as node data
2. Store only primitive types in node/edge attributes
3. Avoid operations that trigger deepcopy (or implement manually)
4. Document any GObject limitations

### Testing Strategy

**Red flags for GObject issues**:
- Error messages mentioning "non-copyable"
- `deepcopy()` in stack trace
- Issues with `pickle`, `multiprocessing`, or `copy`

**Prevention**:
- Test layout algorithms early in development
- Use realistic data (imported models, not just test cases)
- Monitor for deepcopy in third-party library calls

## Related Issues

### Similar Patterns in Codebase

**Check other uses of NetworkX**:
```bash
grep -r "nx.DiGraph\|nx.Graph" src/
```

**Ensure all graph operations**:
- Don't store GObject instances in node/edge data
- Avoid or work around deepcopy operations
- Use objects as IDs, not as data

## Future Considerations

### Alternative Approaches

1. **ID-based graphs** (not chosen):
   ```python
   graph.add_node(place.id, type='place', obj=place)
   ```
   - Still has deepcopy issue with `obj=place`

2. **Weak references** (overcomplicated):
   ```python
   import weakref
   graph.add_edge(u, v, arc_ref=weakref.ref(arc))
   ```
   - Avoids deepcopy issue
   - But adds complexity and potential bugs

3. **Current approach** (chosen):
   ```python
   graph.add_node(place, type='place')  # Object is ID
   graph.add_edge(u, v, weight=1.0)     # Only primitives in data
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Simple and clean
   - ‚úÖ No deepcopy issues
   - ‚úÖ Direct object lookup

### Potential NetworkX Enhancement

Could submit PR to NetworkX to add `to_undirected(copy='shallow')` option:
```python
undirected = graph.to_undirected(copy='shallow')  # No deepcopy
```

But manual approach works fine for now.

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the GObject deepcopy issue by:
1. Removing GObject instances from graph edge data
2. Manually converting directed ‚Üí undirected graphs without deepcopy

**User Impact**: Graph layout algorithms now work correctly with GTK-based applications.

**Architecture Impact**: Establishes pattern for using NetworkX with GObject instances.

**Testing Required**: Verify force-directed and other layouts work on real models.
