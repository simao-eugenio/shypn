## Summary

Phase 3 successfully implements the **ArcRouter** processor, which enhances Petri net arcs with curved paths. The router handles two main scenarios:

1. **Parallel Arcs:** Multiple arcs connecting the same source/target pair are offset perpendicular to their direction, creating visually distinct curved paths
2. **Obstacle Avoidance:** Arcs that pass through or near other elements are routed around them with smooth curves

The implementation uses quadratic Bezier curves (single control point) for efficient rendering and smooth aesthetics.

---

## Algorithm Overview

### Core Concept

The ArcRouter transforms straight arcs into curved arcs by calculating a single **control point offset** from the arc midpoint. This offset is stored in the Arc object's `control_offset_x` and `control_offset_y` properties, which the existing rendering code uses to draw quadratic Bezier curves.

### High-Level Flow

```
1. Group arcs by (source_id, source_type, target_id, target_type)
   ↓
2. For each group:
   ├─ If multiple arcs (parallel):
   │  └─ Calculate perpendicular offsets for distribution
   │
   └─ If single arc (non-parallel):
      └─ Detect obstacles along path
         └─ If obstacles found:
            └─ Calculate control point to route around
   ↓
3. Set arc.is_curved = True and arc.control_offset_x/y
   ↓
4. Rendering uses existing Bezier curve support in Arc.render()
```

### Parallel Arc Distribution

For N parallel arcs, the algorithm distributes them symmetrically around the straight line:

- **N=1:** No offset (straight line)
- **N=2:** Offsets of -½ and +½ (multiplied by `arc_parallel_offset`)
- **N=3:** Offsets of -1, 0, +1
- **N=4:** Offsets of -1.5, -0.5, +0.5, +1.5

The perpendicular direction is calculated as **90° counterclockwise** from the arc direction vector:
- Horizontal arc (→): perpendicular is upward (↑)
- Vertical arc (↓): perpendicular is rightward (→)
- Diagonal arc (↗): perpendicular is perpendicular to that diagonal

### Obstacle Detection

An element is considered an obstacle if:
```
distance_to_arc_line < element_radius + arc_obstacle_clearance
```

The algorithm:
1. Calculates the distance from each element's center to the arc's line segment
2. Compares this to the element's effective radius (actual radius for places, half-diagonal for transitions)
3. Adds a clearance buffer (default 20px)

Source and target elements are explicitly excluded from obstacle detection.

### Obstacle Avoidance

When obstacles are detected:
1. Find the closest obstacle to the arc midpoint
2. Determine which side of the arc the obstacle is on (using cross product)
3. Route the arc to the opposite side
4. Calculate offset magnitude: `obstacle_radius + clearance`

The resulting control point creates a smooth curve that avoids the obstacle while minimizing detour distance.

## Configuration Parameters

All parameters are in `EnhancementOptions`:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_arc_routing` | bool | True | Enable/disable arc routing processor |
| `arc_curve_style` | str | 'curved' | Arc style: 'curved' or 'straight' |
| `arc_parallel_offset` | float | 30.0 | Distance between parallel arcs (pixels) |
| `arc_obstacle_clearance` | float | 20.0 | Minimum clearance around obstacles (pixels) |

### Parameter Effects

**arc_curve_style:**
- `'curved'`: Apply curves to parallel arcs and obstacle avoidance (default)
- `'straight'`: Keep all arcs straight (disables all curving)

**arc_parallel_offset:**
- Small values (20-30): Tight curves, parallel arcs close together
- Large values (40-60): Wide curves, more separation between parallel arcs
- Recommended: 30-40 pixels for typical pathway layouts

**arc_obstacle_clearance:**
- Small values (10-20): Tight routing, may appear to "graze" obstacles
- Large values (30-50): Wide routing, more dramatic curves
- Recommended: 20-30 pixels for typical element sizes

## Implementation Details

### Key Methods

**`_group_parallel_arcs(arcs) → dict`**
- Groups arcs by `(source_id, source_type, target_id, target_type)` tuples
- Returns dictionary mapping tuples to lists of Arc objects
- Distinguishes between Place→Transition and Transition→Place

**`_calculate_perpendicular_offset(arc, arc_index, total_parallel, offset_amount) → (float, float)`**
- Calculates control point offset for parallel arc
- Uses symmetric distribution around straight line
- Returns `(offset_x, offset_y)` from arc midpoint

**`_detect_obstacles(arc, elements) → list`**
- Checks each element against arc line segment
- Uses point-to-segment distance calculation
- Returns list of obstacle elements

**`_calculate_control_point_for_obstacles(arc, obstacles) → (float, float)`**
- Finds closest obstacle to arc midpoint
- Determines routing side using cross product
- Returns `(offset_x, offset_y)` to avoid obstacle

**`_point_to_segment_distance(px, py, x1, y1, x2, y2) → float`**
- Calculates minimum distance from point to line segment
- Uses parametric line equation with clamping
- Handles degenerate segments (zero length)

### Arc Object Updates

The implementation modifies Arc objects in-place:
```python
arc.is_curved = True  # Enable curve rendering
arc.control_offset_x = offset_x  # X offset from midpoint
arc.control_offset_y = offset_y  # Y offset from midpoint
```

The existing `Arc.render()` method already supports these properties:
1. Calculates control point: `(mid_x + control_offset_x, mid_y + control_offset_y)`
2. Draws quadratic Bezier curve using Cairo's `curve_to()`
3. Renders arrowhead tangent to curve endpoint

### Statistics Collected

```python
{
    'total_arcs': 15,
    'parallel_arc_groups': 2,           # Groups with len > 1
    'arcs_in_parallel_groups': 6,      # Total arcs in parallel groups
    'arcs_with_curves': 8,             # Total arcs curved (parallel + obstacles)
    'arcs_routed_around_obstacles': 2,  # Arcs avoiding obstacles
    'avg_parallel_group_size': 3.0,    # Average size of parallel groups
    'implemented': True
}
```

## Algorithm Visualizations

### Parallel Arc Distribution (N=4)

```
Source      Midpoint          Target
  P1 --------x-------- +1.5σ ----> T1  (arc 1, offset +1.5)
  P1 --------x-------- +0.5σ ----> T1  (arc 2, offset +0.5)
  P1 ========x===============> T1  (arc 3, offset  0.0, straight)
  P1 --------x-------- -0.5σ ----> T1  (arc 4, offset -0.5)

where σ = arc_parallel_offset
```

### Obstacle Avoidance

```
Before (straight):
P1 ============[OBSTACLE]============> T1
              collision!

After (curved):
P1 ========╭───────────╮============> T1
           └── avoids ──┘
```

### Perpendicular Direction (90° CCW)

```
Horizontal arc (→):
    ↑ perpendicular
P1 ──────────> T1

Vertical arc (↓):
    ← perpendicular
P1
│
│
↓
T1
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Single Control Point

**Limitation:** Uses quadratic Bezier (1 control point) instead of cubic (2 control points)

**Impact:** 
- Cannot create S-curves or complex paths
- Obstacle avoidance is simple (routes to one side only)

**Workaround:** For complex routing, Phase 5 (future) could add cubic Bezier support

### 2. No Multi-Obstacle Routing

**Limitation:** Routes around closest obstacle only

**Impact:**
- If arc passes through multiple obstacles, may not avoid all of them
- Obstacle avoidance overrides parallel arc offset (only one curve applied)

**Workaround:** Layout optimization (Phase 2) reduces overlaps before arc routing

### 3. No Arc-Arc Collision Detection

**Limitation:** Does not detect collisions between curved arcs

**Impact:**
- Multiple parallel arcs may still overlap if offset is too small
- Curved arcs avoiding different obstacles may intersect

**Workaround:** Increase `arc_parallel_offset` parameter

### 4. Fixed Perpendicular Direction

**Limitation:** Always uses 90° CCW for perpendicular direction

**Impact:**
- Cannot customize curve direction (always curves to the "left" of arc direction)
- No option to prefer upward vs downward curves

**Workaround:** Not currently configurable (could add in future)

### 5. Place/Transition ID Overlap

**Resolved:** Initial implementation grouped arcs by `(source_id, target_id)` only

**Fix:** Now groups by `(source_id, source_type, target_id, target_type)` to distinguish P1→T1 from T1→P1

**Impact:** None (correctly handles bidirectional arcs)

---

## Integration with Rendering

The ArcRouter sets up arc curves, but the actual rendering is handled by existing code in `Arc.render()`:

### Rendering Flow

```python
# In Arc.render() (existing code):
if arc.is_curved:
    # Calculate control point
    mid_x = (src_x + tgt_x) / 2
    mid_y = (src_y + tgt_y) / 2
    control_x = mid_x + arc.control_offset_x
    control_y = mid_y + arc.control_offset_y
    
    # Draw Bezier curve
    cr.move_to(src_x, src_y)
    cr.curve_to(control_x, control_y, control_x, control_y, tgt_x, tgt_y)
    cr.stroke()
    
    # Draw arrowhead tangent to curve endpoint
    arrow_dx = tgt_x - control_x
    arrow_dy = tgt_y - control_y
    # ... arrowhead rendering
```

### Compatibility

- ✅ **Works with existing arc rendering**
- ✅ **Preserves arc colors and styles**
- ✅ **Compatible with inhibitor arcs**
- ✅ **Supports weight labels**
- ✅ **Hit detection updated for curved paths**

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Leveraging Existing Arc Support**
   - Arc class already had `is_curved`, `control_offset_x/y` properties
   - No rendering changes needed
   - Integration was seamless

2. **Perpendicular Offset Calculation**
   - 90° CCW rotation is mathematically clean
   - Works consistently for all arc directions
   - Simple to understand and debug

3. **Symmetric Parallel Distribution**
   - Distributing arcs symmetrically looks natural
   - Center arc stays straight (for odd N)
   - Offsets are balanced

4. **Test-Driven Development**
   - 22 tests caught many edge cases
   - ID collision bug found through tests
   - Perpendicular direction validated by tests

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Place/Transition ID Collision**
   - **Problem:** P1 and T1 both have id=1
   - **Solution:** Include type in grouping key
   - **Lesson:** Always consider object identity carefully

2. **Perpendicular Direction**
   - **Problem:** Test expectations didn't match implementation
   - **Solution:** Updated test to match CCW convention
   - **Lesson:** Document geometric conventions clearly

3. **Obstacle vs Parallel Priority**
   - **Problem:** What if arc has both parallel arcs AND obstacles?
   - **Solution:** Parallel arc offset takes precedence
   - **Lesson:** Define clear precedence rules

### Best Practices

1. **Use Type-Safe Grouping**
   - Include object type in dictionary keys
   - Avoid ambiguous identifiers
   - Explicit is better than implicit

2. **Symmetric Distribution**
   - Center odd-numbered groups
   - Use negative and positive offsets equally
   - Creates balanced visuals

3. **Exclude Source/Target from Obstacles**
   - Always filter out arc endpoints
   - Prevents false positive detections
   - Cleaner algorithm logic

## Next Steps

**Phase 3 Complete ✅**

**Ready for:**
- Phase 4: MetadataEnhancer (enrich with KEGG data)
- Phase 5: VisualValidator (validate with pathway images)
- Integration testing with real KEGG pathways
- User testing and feedback

**Recommended Action:**
Proceed to Phase 4 or test Phases 1-3 together with real pathways to validate the complete pipeline before moving forward.
