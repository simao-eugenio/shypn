# Diagnostic System Update Summary

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Updates**: Transition default type + diagnostic flow documentation

## Changes Made

### 1. Transition Type Default Changed ⭐

**Old Default**: `'immediate'`  
**New Default**: `'continuous'`

This change affects all new transitions created in the application. Continuous transitions are now the default because they better suit:
- Biochemical pathway modeling
- Enzyme kinetics
- Continuous flow systems
- Hybrid Petri nets (SHPN)

### 2. Quick Reference Updated

**File**: `doc/behaviors/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

Updated the transition types table to show continuous as the default (marked with ⭐) and moved it to the top of the list.

### 3. Complete Diagnostic Flow Documentation

**File**: `doc/DIAGNOSTIC_FLOW_COMPLETE.md`

Created comprehensive 500+ line documentation covering:

#### Part 1: NetObject Property Dialogs
- **Place Properties Dialog**: tokens, initial_marking, capacity, etc.
- **Transition Properties Dialog**: type (default continuous), rate_function, guards, etc.
- **Arc Properties Dialog**: arc_type, weight, threshold

Each section includes:
- Properties table with defaults
- Diagnostic flow diagram
- Key methods with code examples
- Type-specific UI sections

#### Part 2: Real-Time Diagnostic Panel
- **Architecture**: How the diagnostic panel integrates with simulation
- **Components**:
  - LocalityDetector: Structure detection
  - LocalityAnalyzer: Static analysis (tokens, weights, balance)
  - LocalityRuntimeAnalyzer: Runtime metrics (firings, throughput, enablement)
- **Update Flow**: 500ms periodic updates during simulation
- **Display Sections**: Transition info, locality structure, static analysis, runtime metrics, recent events

#### Part 3: Data Flow Integration
- Property Dialog → NetObject → Simulation flow
- Simulation → Data Collector → Diagnostic Panel flow
- Context menu integration

#### Part 4: Default Values Summary
- Complete table of all defaults for all object types
- Highlighting the changed transition_type default

#### Part 5: Diagnostic Features by Object Type
- What diagnostics are available for Places
- What diagnostics are available for Transitions
- What diagnostics are available for Arcs

#### Part 6: Testing Checklist
- Property dialog flow test
- Diagnostic panel flow test
- Integration flow test
- Source/sink diagnostics test

#### Part 7: Files Summary
- All relevant files organized by category

## Key Insights from Documentation

### Property Dialogs (Static Configuration)
Property dialogs are for **static configuration** - setting properties that define how objects behave:
- When you change a transition type, the behavior changes
- When you set initial_marking, that's what reset goes back to
- Changes trigger signals for persistency and behavior cache invalidation

### Diagnostic Panel (Dynamic Monitoring)
The diagnostic panel is for **real-time monitoring** during simulation:
- Shows locality structure (P-T-P pattern)
- Displays runtime metrics (firings, throughput)
- Updates every 500ms during simulation
- Shows enablement state and reasons

### Integration Points
1. **Context Menu** → Opens property dialogs OR diagnostic panel
2. **Property Changes** → Invalidate behavior cache → New behavior
3. **Simulation Events** → Data collector → Diagnostic panel updates
4. **Analysis Panels** → Subscribe to same data collector

## Architecture Highlights

### Locality Analysis System
The diagnostic subsystem uses a three-component architecture:

```
LocalityDetector → LocalityAnalyzer → LocalityRuntimeAnalyzer
     (Structure)      (Static)            (Runtime)
```

1. **Detector**: Finds connected places/arcs for a transition
2. **Analyzer**: Computes static properties (weights, balance)
3. **Runtime**: Tracks dynamic execution (firings, throughput)

### Data Collection
```
Simulation Controller
        ↓
   fires transition
        ↓
SimulationDataCollector.on_transition_fired()
        ↓
   stores (time, 'fired', details)
        ↓
DiagnosticsPanel queries every 500ms
        ↓
   formats and displays
```

## User Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Configure New Transition
```
1. Create transition → Defaults to CONTINUOUS ⭐
2. Double-click → Properties dialog
3. See "Continuous" selected in dropdown
4. Enter rate_function: "5.0 * P1"
5. Click OK
6. Run simulation → Continuous flow at rate 5.0 * P1 tokens
```

### Example 2: Monitor Transition During Simulation
```
1. Right-click transition → "Show Diagnostics"
2. See locality structure (inputs/outputs)
3. Click Play button
4. Watch real-time updates:
   - Firing count increases
   - Throughput calculated
   - Enablement state toggles
   - Recent events listed
5. Stop simulation
6. Final metrics displayed
```

### Example 3: Debug Why Transition Isn't Firing
```
1. Transition not firing during simulation
2. Right-click → "Show Diagnostics"
3. Check Enablement section:
   "Status: ✗ DISABLED"
   "Reason: Input place P1 has 2 tokens, requires 5"
4. Double-click P1 → Properties
5. Set tokens = 10
6. Resume simulation
7. Transition fires normally
```
