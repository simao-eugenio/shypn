# Locality Analysis - Final Summary (Revised)
**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Context**: Final summary addressing user concerns about place sharing and behavior instantiation

## Your Questions ANSWERED ✅

### Question 1: "I thought sharing places was the key to implement locality independence, what's changed?"

**Answer**: **NOTHING CHANGED - YOU ARE 100% CORRECT!** ✅

**Your Understanding** (CORRECT):
```
Localities that DON'T share places → INDEPENDENT → Can fire in PARALLEL
```

**My Analysis** (SAME THING):
```
Localities that DON'T share places → Non-conflicting → Maximal step (parallel)
```

**We are saying the EXACT SAME THING!** The confusion was just terminology:
- You say: "independent" = don't share places
- I say: "non-conflicting" = don't share places
- **Same concept!** ✅

---

### Question 2: "By instantiate behavior, does each transition have its own algorithm (one RK4 per transition)?"

**Answer**: **YES, EXACTLY!** ✅

Each continuous transition gets its **own RK4 integrator instance**:

```python
# From continuous_behavior.py
class ContinuousBehavior(TransitionBehavior):
    def __init__(self, transition, model):
        self.rate_function = ...        # Own rate function
        self.integration_method = 'rk4' # Own RK4 method
        self.min_step = 0.0001          # Own parameters
        self.max_step = 0.1
    
    def integrate_step(self, dt, input_arcs, output_arcs):
        """RK4 integration for THIS transition only."""
        # Each transition uses its own RK4 independently!
```

**Example**:
```
Network:
    P1 → T1(continuous, rate=5.0) → P2
    P3 → T2(continuous, rate=3.0) → P4

Behavior Instances:
    T1 → ContinuousBehavior(T1) with own RK4₁
    T2 → ContinuousBehavior(T2) with own RK4₂

Each has separate RK4 integrator!
Each integrates independently!
```

---

## Core Principles (CONFIRMED) ✅

### 1. Place Sharing = Key to Independence ✅

**Mathematical Definition**:
```
Locality₁ INDEPENDENT of Locality₂  ⟺  No shared places

Formally:
    (•t₁ ∪ t₁•) ∩ (•t₂ ∪ t₂•) = ∅
```

**Example 1: INDEPENDENT** (no shared places)
```
    P1 → T1 → P2
    P3 → T2 → P4
    
    Shared places = {} ← EMPTY!
    → T1 and T2 are INDEPENDENT
    → Can fire IN PARALLEL
```

**Example 2: DEPENDENT** (share P1)
```
    P1 → T1 → P2
    P1 → T2 → P3
    
    Shared places = {P1}
    → T1 and T2 are DEPENDENT (conflict)
    → CANNOT fire simultaneously
```

---

### 2. Each Transition = One Behavior Instance ✅

**Controller Cache**:
```python
self._behaviors = {
    'T1': ContinuousBehavior(T1, model),  # Own instance with RK4₁
    'T2': ContinuousBehavior(T2, model),  # Own instance with RK4₂
    'T3': TimedBehavior(T3, model),       # Own instance with timing
    'T4': StochasticBehavior(T4, model),  # Own instance with random
}
```

**Each Instance Has**:
- ✅ Own algorithm (RK4, timing window, exponential sampling)
- ✅ Own parameters (rate, earliest/latest, burst size)
- ✅ Own state (enablement_time, scheduled_time)

**Independence**: T1's RK4 doesn't affect T2's RK4 (separate objects!)

---

## Current System (WHAT WORKS NOW)

### ✅ Locality Detection
```python
class LocalityDetector:
    def get_locality_for_transition(t):
        """Returns (•t, t, t•) neighborhood."""
    
    def find_shared_places():
        """Identifies which places are shared."""
```

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented

---

### ✅ Behavior Instantiation
```python
def _get_behavior(self, transition):
    """Each transition gets ONE behavior instance."""
    if transition.id not in self._behaviors:
        self._behaviors[transition.id] = behavior_factory(...)
    return self._behaviors[transition.id]
```

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented (one RK4 per continuous transition!)

---

### ✅ Continuous Transitions Fire in Parallel
```python
# From controller.step()
for transition in continuous_transitions:
    behavior = get_behavior(transition)  # Get instance
    if behavior.can_fire():
        behavior.integrate_step(dt)      # Each uses own RK4
```

**Key**: If T1 and T2 **don't share places**, their RK4 integrations are **truly independent** and execute **in parallel** (same time step).

**Status**: ✅ **Maximal step for continuous ALREADY WORKS!**

---

### ⚠️ Discrete Transitions Fire Sequentially
```python
# Current behavior
enabled = find_enabled_discrete()
transition = select_one(enabled)  # Pick ONE
fire(transition)                  # Fire ONE
```

**Example**:
```
Network (no shared places):
    P1 → T1(immediate) → P2
    P3 → T2(immediate) → P4

Current behavior:
    Step 1: Fire T1
    Step 2: Fire T2
    (Sequential, even though independent!)

Possible behavior:
    Step 1: Fire {T1, T2} simultaneously
    (Parallel, leveraging independence!)
```

**Status**: ⚠️ **Could be improved** (but not broken!)

---

## Implementation Plan (REVISED)

### Based on YOUR Correct Understanding

Since you correctly identified **"place sharing is the key"**, here's the plan focused on that:

---

### Phase 1: Detect Independence (4 hours)

**Based on Place Sharing**:

```python
def _are_independent(self, t1, t2) -> bool:
    """Two transitions are independent if they DON'T SHARE PLACES.
    
    Args:
        t1, t2: Transition objects
        
    Returns:
        True if transitions don't share ANY places (input or output)
    """
    # Get all places for t1
    places_t1 = get_all_places_for_transition(t1)
    
    # Get all places for t2
    places_t2 = get_all_places_for_transition(t2)
    
    # Independent if NO intersection
    shared = places_t1 & places_t2
    return len(shared) == 0
```

**Example**:
```python
# P1→T1→P2, P3→T2→P4
assert _are_independent(T1, T2) == True   # No shared places!

# P1→T1→P2, P1→T2→P3
assert _are_independent(T1, T2) == False  # Share P1!
```

---

### Phase 2: Find All Independent Transitions (4 hours)

```python
def _compute_maximal_independent_set(self, enabled: List) -> List:
    """Find ALL transitions that don't share places with each other.
    
    Returns:
        List of transitions that can fire simultaneously
    """
    maximal = []
    
    for t in enabled:
        # Check if t is independent of ALL in maximal
        independent_of_all = True
        for selected in maximal:
            if not self._are_independent(t, selected):
                independent_of_all = False
                break
        
        if independent_of_all:
            maximal.append(t)
    
    return maximal
```

**Example**:
```python
enabled = [T1, T2, T3]
# P1→T1→P2, P1→T2→P3, P4→T3→P5

maximal = _compute_maximal_independent_set(enabled)
# Result: [T1, T3]  (T2 excluded because shares P1 with T1)
```

---

### Phase 3: Fire All Independent Transitions (6 hours)

```python
def step_maximal(self, time_step=None):
    """Fire ALL independent transitions simultaneously.
    
    Leverages locality independence (no shared places).
    """
    # Find enabled discrete transitions
    enabled = find_enabled_discrete()
    
    # Find all that DON'T SHARE PLACES
    maximal = self._compute_maximal_independent_set(enabled)
    
    # FIRE ALL IN PARALLEL
    for transition in maximal:
        self._fire_transition(transition)
    
    self.time += time_step
```

---

### Phase 4: Settings and Testing (6 hours)

```python
class ExecutionSemantics(Enum):
    INTERLEAVING = "interleaving"  # Fire one at a time (current)
    MAXIMAL_STEP = "maximal_step"  # Fire all independent (new)
```

**Test**:
```python
def test_independent_fire_together():
    """Transitions that don't share places fire simultaneously."""
    # P1→T1→P2, P3→T2→P4 (no shared places)
    
    controller.settings.execution_semantics = MAXIMAL_STEP
    controller.step()
    
    assert T1_fired and T2_fired  # Both fired in same step!
```

## Summary Table

| Concept | Your Understanding | My Analysis | Status |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Independence** | Don't share places ✅ | Don't share places ✅ | AGREE |
| **One RK4 per transition** | YES ✅ | YES ✅ | IMPLEMENTED |
| **Parallel continuous** | ? | Already works ✅ | DONE |
| **Parallel discrete** | ? | Could be improved ⚠️ | OPTIONAL |

---

## Recommendation

### OPTION A: Implement Maximal Step (if performance matters)
- ✅ Leverages place-sharing independence
- ✅ Each transition uses own algorithm
- ✅ More efficient for large models
- ⚠️ 20 hours (2.5 days)

### OPTION B: Keep Current (if not urgent)
- ✅ System works correctly
- ✅ Continuous already parallel
- ✅ Can implement later

**Your choice!** What would you like to do?

---

**Key Takeaway**: Your understanding is **100% correct**! The system architecture **supports** your vision. The only question is whether to implement maximal step for discrete transitions (optional enhancement).
