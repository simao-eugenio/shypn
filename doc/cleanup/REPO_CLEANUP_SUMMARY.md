## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Legacy Directory

- **Reason**: Content was outdated
- **Action**: Complete deletion via `rm -rf`

### 2. Moved Deprecated Files to `archive/deprecated/`

The following files were identified as not being actively imported or used in the production codebase and moved to `archive/deprecated/`:

#### Backup/Old Versions (2 files)

   - Old version of PathwayPostProcessor
   - Replaced by current `pathway_postprocessor.py`
   
2. `src/shypn/data/pathway/tree_layout.py.backup`
   - Backup file of tree layout implementation
   - Preserved from previous refactoring

#### Development/Example Files (2 files)
3. `src/shypn/dev/example_dev.py`
   - Development example file
   - Not imported anywhere in production code

4. `src/shypn/edit/palette_integration_example.py`
   - Example demonstrating palette integration
   - Not imported in production code

#### Testbed Directories (2 directories)
5. `src/shypn/dev/swissknife_testbed/`
   - Development testbed for SwissKnife palette experimentation
   - Contains test applications not used in production

6. `src/shypn/dev/settings_sub_palette_testbed/`
   - Development testbed for settings sub-palette
   - Contains mock/test code not used in production

## Files NOT Moved

The following files were considered but kept in place because they ARE actively used:

- `src/shypn/edit/tools_palette_new.py` - Used by model_canvas_loader.py
- `src/shypn/edit/operations_palette_new.py` - Used by model_canvas_loader.py
- `src/shypn/edit/tools_palette.py` - Used by canvas_overlay_manager.py
- `src/shypn/edit/operations_palette.py` - Used by canvas_overlay_manager.py
- `src/shypn/helpers/example_helper.py` - Used by test_helpers.py
- `examples/matrix_integration_example.py` - Working example, should stay in examples/

## Repository Status

- **Legacy code**: Removed
- **Deprecated files**: Organized in `archive/deprecated/`
- **Active codebase**: Clean and maintained
- **Examples**: Kept in place
- **Tests**: Unchanged
- **Scripts**: Unchanged

## Notes

- All moved files are preserved for reference in `archive/deprecated/`
- A README.md was created in `archive/deprecated/` documenting what was moved and why
- The codebase maintains both old and new palette systems as both are actively used
