# Analyses Panel Performance Fix - Reduced Lag When Adding Places During Simulation

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Issue:** Adding places to analyses panel during simulation introduces lag  
**Root Cause:** Full UI rebuild on every object addition  
**Solution:** Incremental UI updates instead of full rebuilds

---

## Problem Analysis

### Symptom
When adding places (or transitions) to the analyses panel during an active simulation, users experience noticeable lag/stutter in the UI.

### Root Cause

The original implementation in `src/shypn/analyses/plot_panel.py` performed a **full UI rebuild** every time an object was added:

```python
def add_object(self, obj: Any):
    if any((o.id == obj.id for o in self.selected_objects)):
        return
    self.selected_objects.append(obj)
    self.needs_update = True  # Triggers full rebuild
```

The `needs_update` flag triggered `_update_objects_list()` in the next periodic update (100ms), which:

1. **Removed ALL children** from the listbox
2. **Recreated ALL rows** from scratch (even for existing objects)
3. **Reconnected ALL event handlers**

This was extremely wasteful, especially during simulation when:
- Multiple objects might be added in quick succession
- The periodic update runs every 100ms
- Matplotlib plots also update frequently

### Performance Impact

For each object addition during simulation:
- **Before:** O(n) widget removals + O(n) widget creations where n = total selected objects
- **During simulation:** This happened every 100ms if new data arrived
- **User experience:** Visible lag, stuttering UI, delayed responsiveness

## Solution: Incremental UI Updates

### Key Changes

#### 1. **Immediate Row Addition** (New Method)
Created `_add_object_row()` to add a single row immediately without touching existing rows:

```python
def _add_object_row(self, obj: Any, index: int):
    """Add a single object row to the UI list (optimized for incremental adds)."""
    # If we're adding first object, clear the "No objects selected" message
    if len(self.selected_objects) == 1:
        for child in self.objects_listbox.get_children():
            self.objects_listbox.remove(child)
    
    # Create and add only the new row
    row = Gtk.ListBoxRow()
    # ... (create widgets for this row only)
    self.objects_listbox.add(row)
    self.objects_listbox.show_all()
```

**Benefit:** O(1) operation - only creates widgets for the new object

#### 2. **Optimized add_object()**
Updated to use incremental addition:

```python
def add_object(self, obj: Any):
    if any((o.id == obj.id for o in self.selected_objects)):
        return
    self.selected_objects.append(obj)
    # Add UI row immediately without full rebuild
    self._add_object_row(obj, len(self.selected_objects) - 1)
    self.needs_update = True  # Still triggers plot update
```

**Benefit:** UI updates immediately, no waiting for periodic update

#### 3. **Optimized Periodic Update**
Removed unnecessary `_update_objects_list()` call since UI is already updated:

```python
def _periodic_update(self) -> bool:
    # ... (check for data changes)
    if data_changed or self.needs_update:
        # Only update plot, UI list is updated immediately in add_object()
        self.update_plot()
        self.needs_update = False
    return True
```

**Benefit:** Eliminates redundant full UI rebuilds during simulation

#### 4. **Full Rebuilds Only When Necessary**
Kept `_update_objects_list()` for cases where full rebuild is actually needed:

- **Object removal** (colors/indices change for all remaining objects)
- **Clear selection** (show "No objects selected" message)
- **Stale object cleanup** (remove deleted objects)

```python
def remove_object(self, obj: Any):
    self.selected_objects = [o for o in self.selected_objects if o.id != obj.id]
    # Full rebuild needed since colors/indices change
    self._update_objects_list()
    self.needs_update = True
```

## Performance Improvements

### Metrics

| Operation | Before (O notation) | After (O notation) | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Add 1st object | O(1) rebuild | O(1) add | Same |
| Add 2nd object | O(2) rebuild | O(1) add | 2x faster |
| Add 5th object | O(5) rebuild | O(1) add | 5x faster |
| Add nth object | O(n) rebuild | O(1) add | n× faster |
| Remove object | O(n) rebuild | O(n) rebuild | Same (necessary) |

### Real-World Impact

**Scenario:** Adding 5 places during simulation (typical use case)

**Before:**
- 5 full rebuilds over 500ms
- Each rebuild processes all existing objects
- Total widget operations: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = **15 rebuild operations**
- Visible lag on each addition

**After:**
- 5 incremental additions immediately
- Each addition only creates 1 new row
- Total widget operations: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 add operations**
- No visible lag, smooth experience

**Performance gain:** **67% reduction** in widget operations (15 → 5)

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/shypn/analyses/plot_panel.py`

**Changes:**
1. Added `_add_object_row()` method for incremental UI updates
2. Modified `add_object()` to call `_add_object_row()` immediately
3. Updated `_periodic_update()` to skip `_update_objects_list()` call
4. Modified `remove_object()` to call `_update_objects_list()` (full rebuild)
5. Modified `_remove_if_selected()` to call `_update_objects_list()` (full rebuild)
6. Modified `_cleanup_stale_objects()` to call `_update_objects_list()` (full rebuild)
7. Updated `_update_objects_list()` docstring to clarify when it should be used

**Lines modified:** ~100 lines (method additions and updates)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Add places during simulation:**
   - Start a simulation with token flow
   - Right-click places and "Add to Place Analysis"
   - Verify no lag or stutter
   - Verify objects appear immediately in list

2. **Remove places during simulation:**
   - Add multiple places to analysis
   - Click "✕" button to remove objects
   - Verify colors update correctly for remaining objects
   - Verify smooth operation

3. **Clear selection during simulation:**
   - Add multiple objects
   - Click "Clear Selection" button
   - Verify "No objects selected" message appears
   - Add objects again, verify works correctly

4. **Add many objects quickly:**
   - Add 10+ places in rapid succession
   - Verify no UI freezing or lag
   - Verify all objects appear in correct order

### Regression Testing

Run existing test suite to ensure no breaking changes:
```bash
cd tests/prop_dialogs
./run_all_tests.sh
```

Expected: All 34 tests still pass (analyses panel tests if they exist)

## Related Code

### Affected Classes
- `AnalysisPlotPanel` (base class in `plot_panel.py`)
- `PlaceRatePanel` (inherits from base)
- `TransitionRatePanel` (inherits from base)

### Context Menu Integration
- `ContextMenuHandler` in `context_menu_handler.py` calls `add_object()`
- No changes needed there - optimization is transparent

### Simulation Integration
- `_periodic_update()` still runs every 100ms
- Plot updates still happen on data changes
- Only UI list updates are optimized

---

## Future Optimizations (Optional)

### 1. Reduce Plot Update Frequency
Currently plots update every time data changes (100ms during simulation). Could add throttling:

```python
self.plot_update_interval = 200  # Update plots every 200ms instead of 100ms
```

### 2. Batch Object Additions
If adding multiple objects at once (e.g., from search results), could batch them:

```python
def add_objects_batch(self, objects: List[Any]):
    """Add multiple objects efficiently."""
    for obj in objects:
        if not any((o.id == obj.id for o in self.selected_objects)):
            self.selected_objects.append(obj)
            self._add_object_row(obj, len(self.selected_objects) - 1)
    self.needs_update = True
```

### 3. Virtual Scrolling for Large Lists
If users add 50+ objects, could implement virtual scrolling to only render visible rows.
