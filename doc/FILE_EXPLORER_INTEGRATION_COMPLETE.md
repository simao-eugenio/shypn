# File Explorer Integration - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing  
**Implementation:** Option A - Complete Integration

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented complete integration between FileExplorerPanel and NetObjPersistency, making the file explorer fully aware of file operations and keeping the UI synchronized with document state.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. FileExplorerPanel - New Integration Methods ✅

**File:** `src/shypn/ui/panels/file_explorer_panel.py`

#### Added `set_persistency_manager()` method:
```python
def set_persistency_manager(self, persistency):
    """Wire file explorer to persistency manager for file operations integration."""
    self.persistency = persistency
    
    # Wire callbacks to receive notifications
    persistency.on_file_saved = self._on_file_saved_callback
    persistency.on_file_loaded = self._on_file_loaded_callback
    persistency.on_dirty_changed = self._on_dirty_changed_callback
```

#### Added Callback Handlers:

**`_on_file_saved_callback(filepath)`:**
- Updates current file display with saved filename
- Refreshes file explorer tree to show new file

**`_on_file_loaded_callback(filepath, document)`:**
- Updates current file display with loaded filename
- File explorer stays aware of current document

**`_on_dirty_changed_callback(is_dirty)`:**
- Shows asterisk (*) in current file display when document has unsaved changes
- Removes asterisk when document is saved
- Example: `"myfile.json *"` → `"myfile.json"`

---

### 2. Removed Stub Handlers ✅

**File:** `src/shypn/ui/panels/file_explorer_panel.py`

**Removed methods:**
- `_on_file_new_clicked()` - Was a stub
- `_on_file_open_clicked()` - Was a stub  
- `_on_file_save_clicked()` - Was a stub
- `_on_file_save_as_clicked()` - Was a stub

**Removed signal connections:**
```python
# REMOVED:
# if self.new_button:
#     self.new_button.connect("clicked", self._on_file_new_clicked)
# if self.open_button:
#     self.open_button.connect("clicked", self._on_file_open_clicked)
# ...etc
```

**Added clear documentation:**
```python
# NOTE: File operation toolbar buttons (New/Open/Save/Save As) are handled
# in shypn.py main app to integrate with NetObjPersistency and ModelCanvasLoader.
# Only the New Folder button is handled here for file explorer-specific operations.
```

---

### 3. Context Menu Integration ✅

**File:** `src/shypn/ui/panels/file_explorer_panel.py`

#### Added `on_file_open_requested` callback:
```python
# Callback for opening files (set by main app to integrate with canvas)
self.on_file_open_requested: Optional[Callable[[str], None]] = None
```

#### Updated `_on_open_clicked()` (Context Menu "Open"):
```python
def _on_open_clicked(self, button):
    """Handle 'Open' context menu button."""
    if self.selected_item_path and not self.selected_item_is_dir:
        # Check if file is a .json file (Petri net file)
        if not self.selected_item_path.endswith('.json'):
            if self.explorer.on_error:
                self.explorer.on_error("Can only open .json Petri net files")
            return
        
        # Request main app to open this file
        if self.on_file_open_requested:
            self.on_file_open_requested(self.selected_item_path)
```

#### Updated `_on_row_activated()` (Double-Click):
```python
def _on_row_activated(self, tree_view, path, column):
    """Handle double-click on row."""
    # ... get row data ...
    
    if is_dir:
        # Navigate into directory
        self.explorer.navigate_to(full_path)
    else:
        # File activated - request main app to open it
        if full_path.endswith('.json'):
            # Request main app to open this Petri net file
            if self.on_file_open_requested:
                self.on_file_open_requested(full_path)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Only opens .json files (Petri net format)
- ✅ Shows error for non-JSON files
- ✅ Works from context menu "Open"
- ✅ Works from double-click on file

---

### 4. Main App Integration ✅

**File:** `src/shypn.py`

#### Added File Explorer Integration Section:

```python
# ====================================================================
# Wire File Explorer to Persistency Manager
# ====================================================================

# Get file explorer instance from left panel
file_explorer = left_panel_loader.file_explorer

if file_explorer:
    # Wire persistency manager to file explorer for UI updates
    file_explorer.set_persistency_manager(persistency)
    
    # Wire file explorer's open request to load into canvas
    def on_file_open_requested(filepath):
        """Handle file open request from file explorer."""
        try:
            # Load document directly
            from shypn.document import DocumentModel
            import json
            
            with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                data = json.load(f)
            
            document = DocumentModel.from_dict(data)
            
            if document:
                # Create new tab with loaded document
                filename = os.path.basename(filepath)
                base_name = os.path.splitext(filename)[0]
                
                page_index, drawing_area = model_canvas_loader.add_document(filename=base_name)
                
                # Replace the document in the canvas manager
                manager = model_canvas_loader.get_canvas_manager(drawing_area)
                if manager:
                    manager.document = document
                    manager.places = list(document.places)
                    manager.transitions = list(document.transitions)
                    manager.arcs = list(document.arcs)
                    
                    # Update persistency manager state
                    persistency.current_filepath = filepath
                    persistency.mark_clean()
                    
                    drawing_area.queue_draw()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[File Explorer] Error loading file: {e}")
    
    file_explorer.on_file_open_requested = on_file_open_requested
```

**What This Does:**
1. Gets file explorer instance from left panel loader
2. Wires persistency callbacks (save/load/dirty notifications)
3. Wires file open callback (double-click/context menu)
4. Loads document from JSON file
5. Injects document into canvas manager
6. Updates persistency state (current file, clean state)
7. Triggers canvas redraw

```
User clicks Save button in toolbar
    ↓
shypn.py: on_save_document() handler
    ↓
NetObjPersistency.save_document()
    ↓
NetObjPersistency calls: on_file_saved callback
    ↓
FileExplorerPanel._on_file_saved_callback()
    ↓
Updates current file display
Refreshes file explorer tree
```

### Load Operation (Toolbar):
```
User clicks Open button in toolbar
    ↓
shypn.py: on_open_document() handler
    ↓

    ↓
Loads document into canvas
    ↓
NetObjPersistency calls: on_file_loaded callback
    ↓

Updates current file display
```

### Load Operation (File Explorer):
```
User double-clicks .json file OR right-click → Open
    ↓
FileExplorerPanel._on_row_activated() OR _on_open_clicked()
    ↓
Calls: on_file_open_requested callback

Updates current file display
```

### Dirty State:
```
User modifies document (adds place, edits transition, etc.)
    ↓
NetObjPersistency.mark_dirty() called
    ↓
NetObjPersistency calls: on_dirty_changed callback
    ↓
FileExplorerPanel._on_dirty_changed_callback(is_dirty=True)
    ↓
Adds asterisk to current file display: "myfile.json *"

User saves document
    ↓
NetObjPersistency.save_document()
    ↓
NetObjPersistency.mark_clean() called

   - Add asterisk to tab label when document dirty
   - Remove when saved

2. **Highlight current file in tree:**
   - When file is opened, highlight it in file explorer tree
   - Scroll tree to show highlighted file

3. **Drag & drop:**
   - Drag .json file from tree onto canvas to open
   - Drop file from OS file manager

4. **Recent files menu:**
   - Keep list of recently opened files
   - Quick access via menu

5. **Auto-save:**
   - Periodic auto-save to temp file

1. Run application: `python3 src/shypn.py`
2. Follow testing checklist above
3. Verify all features work as expected
4. Check console for any error messages

- Shows dirty state indicator
- Context menu and double-click open files
- No duplicate handlers
- Clean, maintainable architecture
