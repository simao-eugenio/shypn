# File Panel Refinements - Complete ✅

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** All refinements implemented and tested

## Refinements Implemented

### 1. ✅ Panel Title Changed to "EXPLORER" (Capital Letters)
**File:** `ui/panels/left_panel_vscode.ui`
- Changed window title from "File Explorer" to "EXPLORER"
- Changed panel label from "Explorer" to "EXPLORER"

### 2. ✅ Category Expansion Behavior
**File:** `src/shypn/helpers/file_panel_loader.py`
- FILES category: `expanded=True` (opens expanded)
- PROJECT INFORMATION: `expanded=False` (collapsed by default)
- PROJECT ACTIONS: `expanded=False` (collapsed by default)
**Status:** Already correctly implemented

### 3. ✅ All File Operations Now Inline (No Dialogs)

#### File → Open
**Behavior:** Opens the currently selected file in the tree view
- No file chooser dialog
- If no file selected: does nothing
- If directory selected: does nothing
- Only opens .shy files

**File Modified:** `src/shypn/helpers/file_explorer_panel.py` - `open_document()` method

#### File → Save
**Behavior:** Auto-saves with generated filename
- New/unsaved file: Auto-generates timestamp-based name (e.g., `model_20251025_111732.shy`)
- Existing file: Saves directly to current filepath
- Files saved to current workspace directory
- No save dialog shown

**File Modified:** `src/shypn/helpers/file_explorer_panel.py` - `save_current_document()` method

#### File → Save As
**Behavior:** Auto-saves copy with generated filename
- Creates copy with "_copy" suffix
- If file already exists, adds counter: `filename_1.shy`, `filename_2.shy`, etc.
- No save dialog shown

**File Modified:** `src/shypn/helpers/file_explorer_panel.py` - `save_current_document_as()` method

## Test Results

### test_inline_operations.py
```
✓ File auto-saved: model_20251025_111732.shy
✓ is_dirty after save: False
✓ New file created: model_20251025_111732_copy.shy
✓ File exists on disk
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ Auto-save generates unique timestamp-based filenames
- ✅ Save As creates copies with "_copy" suffix
- ✅ Files written to workspace directory
- ✅ Canvas state updated correctly (is_dirty = False)
- ✅ Tab labels updated with new filenames
- ✅ No dialogs shown during operations

## User Experience

### Opening Files
1. Navigate to file in EXPLORER tree
2. Select the .shy file
3. Press Ctrl+O or File→Open
4. File opens immediately (no dialog)

### Saving Files
1. Make changes to canvas
2. Press Ctrl+S or File→Save
3. File auto-saves with timestamp name (no dialog)
4. See filename in tab label
5. File appears in EXPLORER tree

### Save As (Creating Copy)
1. Open existing file
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+S or File→Save As
3. Copy created with "_copy" suffix (no dialog)
4. New tab shows copy name
5. Copy appears in EXPLORER tree

## Files Modified

1. **ui/panels/left_panel_vscode.ui**
   - Changed title to "EXPLORER" (capital letters)

2. **src/shypn/helpers/file_explorer_panel.py**
   - `open_document()`: Opens selected file from tree (no dialog)
   - `save_current_document()`: Auto-saves with generated name (no dialog)
   - `save_current_document_as()`: Auto-saves copy with suffix (no dialog)

## Benefits

✅ **Faster workflow:** No interruptions from dialogs
✅ **Inline operations:** Everything visible in EXPLORER panel
✅ **Auto-naming:** Timestamp-based names prevent conflicts
✅ **Copy safety:** "_copy" suffix makes duplicates obvious
✅ **Tree visibility:** All files immediately visible in EXPLORER

## Conclusion

All three refinements implemented and working correctly:
1. ✅ Title is "EXPLORER" (capitals)
2. ✅ Only FILES category expanded by default
3. ✅ All operations inline (no dialogs)
