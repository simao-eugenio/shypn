## Test Results by Suite

| Suite | Pass | Total | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| **Basic Time** | 12 | 12 | ✅ 100% |
| **Immediate** | 6 | 6 | ✅ 100% |
| **Timed** | 7 | 9 | ⚠️ 78% (1 skip, 1 xfail) |
| **Continuous** | 10 | 11 | ⚠️ 91% (1 xfail) |

## Critical Bug Fixed ✅

**Negative Time Steps** - Time could go backwards!

```python
# Before: Time could become negative
controller.step(-1.0)  # ❌ Time goes to -1.0!

# After: Properly validated
controller.step(-1.0)  # ✅ Raises ValueError
```

**Impact:** System now guarantees monotonic time progression.

---

## Known Issues (Documented)

### 1. Timed Window Skipping ⚠️

**Problem:** Large dt can skip narrow timing windows.

```python
# Window: [2.0, 2.0] (zero width)
# Steps: 0.0 → 1.8 → 2.1
# Result: Window missed! ❌
```

**Workaround:** Use `dt <= window_width / 2`

**Fix Status:** Infrastructure added, needs controller integration

### 2. Continuous Overflow ⚠️

**Problem:** Doesn't limit transfer to available tokens.

```python
# P1 has 5 tokens, rate = 1000
# Transfers 1000 tokens! ❌
```

**Fix Status:** Straightforward clamping logic needed

---

## API Pattern Established

```python
from shypn.data.model_canvas_manager import ModelCanvasManager
from shypn.engine.simulation.controller import SimulationController

# Create model
model = ModelCanvasManager()

# Add place
p1 = model.add_place(x=100, y=100, label="P1")
p1.tokens = 10
p1.initial_marking = 10

# Add transition
t1 = model.add_transition(x=200, y=100, label="T1")
t1.transition_type = 'timed'  # immediate, timed, continuous, stochastic

# Configure timed properties
if not hasattr(t1, 'properties'):
    t1.properties = {}
t1.properties['earliest'] = 1.0
t1.properties['latest'] = 2.0

# For continuous transitions
t1.properties['rate_function'] = "2.0 * P1"

# Add arc
model.add_arc(p1, t1, weight=1)

# Create controller
controller = SimulationController(model)
controller.step(0.1)
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all time tests
pytest tests/test_time_*.py -v

# Run specific suite
pytest tests/test_time_basic.py -v
pytest tests/test_time_immediate.py -v
pytest tests/test_time_timed.py -v
pytest tests/test_time_continuous.py -v

# Quick summary
pytest tests/test_time_*.py --tb=no
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix Timed Window Skipping** (controller-level)
   - Investigate discrete transition selection
   - Integrate window-crossing detection
   - Target: 2 more tests passing

2. **Fix Continuous Overflow** (behavior-level)
   - Add transfer clamping
   - Target: 1 more test passing

### Future Work
- Phase 2: Integration tests (hybrid models)
- Phase 3: Edge cases
- Phase 4: Performance testing
- Stochastic transition tests
