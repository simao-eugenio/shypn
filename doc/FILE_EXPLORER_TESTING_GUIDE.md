   ```
2. Launch application
3. Right-click the test.txt file
4. Select "Open"

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Error message shown: "Can only open .json Petri net files"
- âœ… File NOT opened
- âœ… Current file display unchanged

---

### Test 6: Dirty State Indicator

**Steps:**
1. Launch application
2. Open an existing file (any method)
3. Current file display shows: "filename.json"
4. Make a change (add a place, move an object, etc.)
5. Observe current file display
6. Click "Save" button
7. Observe current file display again

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… After change: Display shows "filename.json *" (with asterisk)
- âœ… After save: Display shows "filename.json" (no asterisk)

---

### Test 7: Save As Updates Display

**Steps:**
1. Launch application
2. Open an existing file

### Test 8: New Document

**Steps:**
1. Launch application (already has a document)
2. Make changes to current document (adds dirty state)
3. Click "New" button

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Unsaved changes dialog appears
- âœ… If "Discard": New tab created, current file display clears or shows "untitled"
- âœ… If "Cancel": No new tab, stays on current document

---

### Test 9: File Explorer Operations Still Work

**Steps:**
1. Launch application
2. Test file explorer operations:
   - Right-click â†’ "New Folder"
   - Right-click file â†’ "Rename"
   - Right-click file â†’ "Copy"
   - Right-click folder â†’ "Paste"
   - Right-click file â†’ "Delete"
   - Right-click file â†’ "Properties"

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… All operations work as before
- âœ… No interference with file open operations
- âœ… Tree refreshes after operations

---

### Test 10: Multiple Files in Subdirectories

**Steps:**
1. Create subdirectory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p models/project1
   mkdir -p models/project2
   ```
2. Save files in different directories
3. Navigate between directories in file explorer
4. Open files from different directories

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Can navigate into subdirectories
- âœ… Can open files from any subdirectory
- âœ… Current file display shows relative path (e.g., "project1/model.json")
- âœ… Double-click and context menu work in subdirectories

---

### Test 11: File Tree Refreshes After Save

**Steps:**
1. Launch application
2. Create new document
3. Add some objects
4. Click "Save"
5. Enter new filename
6. Save to models directory
7. Look at file explorer tree

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… New file appears in tree immediately
- âœ… Tree shows correct filename
- âœ… Can immediately double-click the new file to re-open it

---

### Test 12: Switching Between Tabs

**Steps:**
1. Launch application
2. Open file A
3. Open file B (new tab)
4. Open file C (new tab)
5. Click between tabs

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Current file display updates to show current tab's filename
- âœ… Dirty state indicator (asterisk) reflects current tab's state
- âœ… Each tab maintains its own state

**Note:** This test may reveal that current file display doesn't update on tab switch. If so, that's a known limitation - the callback only updates on save/load, not on tab switching. This would be an enhancement for the future.

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Current File Display Shows Stale Data
**Solution:** This was the problem we fixed! Ensure:
- `file_explorer.set_persistency_manager(persistency)` is called in shypn.py
- Callbacks are wired correctly

### Issue: Context Menu "Open" Doesn't Work
**Solution:** Ensure:
- `file_explorer.on_file_open_requested` callback is set in shypn.py
- File is a .json file

### Issue: Dirty State Indicator Doesn't Appear
**Solution:** Ensure:
- `_on_dirty_changed_callback` is wired in FileExplorerPanel
- `persistency.mark_dirty()` is called when document changes
- This might require additional wiring in canvas manager

### Issue: Double-Click Does Nothing
**Solution:** Check:
- `_on_row_activated` handler is connected
- `on_file_open_requested` callback is set
- Console for error messages

---

## Verification Checklist

After running all tests:

- [ ] âœ… Current file display always accurate
- [ ] âœ… Dirty state indicator works (asterisk)
- [ ] âœ… Toolbar Open button works
- [ ] âœ… Double-click opens files
- [ ] âœ… Context menu Open works
- [ ] âœ… Context menu validates file type
- [ ] âœ… Save updates display
- [ ] âœ… Save As updates display
- [ ] âœ… New document clears/updates display
- [ ] âœ… File tree refreshes after save
- [ ] âœ… Subdirectories work
- [ ] âœ… File explorer operations still work

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Tab Switching:** Current file display may not update when switching between tabs (only updates on save/load operations). This would require additional integration with the tab management system.

2. **Dirty State Propagation:** The dirty state must be propagated from canvas operations to persistency manager. This might require:
   - Calling `persistency.mark_dirty()` from canvas manager when objects are modified
   - Wiring canvas change events to persistency

3. **Auto-Highlight in Tree:** Currently doesn't highlight the opened file in the tree view. This is an enhancement for the future.

---

## Next Steps If Tests Fail

### If current file display doesn't update:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify `set_persistency_manager()` is called
3. Add debug prints in callback methods
4. Check callback is actually being invoked

### If dirty state doesn't work:
1. Check if `mark_dirty()` is being called
2. Verify `on_dirty_changed` callback is wired
3. Add debug print in `_on_dirty_changed_callback`
4. May need to wire canvas operations to call `mark_dirty()`

### If context menu open doesn't work:
1. Check file extension (.json)
2. Verify `on_file_open_requested` callback is set
3. Check for exceptions in console
4. Add debug print in callback handler

---

## Debug Mode

To enable debug output, add print statements at key points:

```python
# In FileExplorerPanel._on_file_saved_callback
def _on_file_saved_callback(self, filepath):
    print(f"[DEBUG] File saved callback: {filepath}")
    self.set_current_file(filepath)
    self._load_current_directory()

# In FileExplorerPanel._on_dirty_changed_callback  
def _on_dirty_changed_callback(self, is_dirty):
    print(f"[DEBUG] Dirty state changed: {is_dirty}")
    # ... rest of method

# In shypn.py on_file_open_requested
def on_file_open_requested(filepath):
    print(f"[DEBUG] File open requested: {filepath}")
    try:
        # ... rest of method
```

This will show in console when callbacks are invoked.

---

## Success Criteria

Integration is successful if:

âœ… All 12 test scenarios pass  
âœ… Current file display always accurate  
âœ… Dirty state indicator works  
âœ… Multiple ways to open files work  
âœ… File explorer operations unchanged  
âœ… No regression in existing functionality
