# Time Computation Testing - Progress Report

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Status:** ✅ Critical bug fixed, Phase 1 in progress

---

## 🎉 Major Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Critical Bug Found and Fixed

**Bug:** Negative time steps accepted, causing time to go backwards

**Discovery Process:**
```python
# Before fix:
controller.step(-1.0)
print(controller.time)  # -1.0 ❌ TIME WENT BACKWARDS!
```

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# In SimulationController.step():
if time_step < 0:
    raise ValueError(f"time_step must be non-negative, got {time_step}")

# Also added warning for large dt:
if time_step > 1.0:
    logger.warning("Large time step may cause timed transitions to miss firing windows")
```

**Verification:**
```python
# After fix:
controller.step(-1.0)  # ✅ Raises ValueError
```

**Impact:**
- 🔴 **Severity:** CRITICAL
- ✅ **Status:** FIXED and verified
- 📊 **Test:** `test_negative_time_step_rejected` now passes

## 🔍 Key Findings

### What Works Excellently ✅

1. **Time Advancement**
   - Single steps: Perfect accuracy
   - Multiple steps: Correct accumulation
   - Varying dt: No issues

2. **Numerical Stability**
   - 1000 steps of dt=0.001: Error < 1e-6
   - No catastrophic cancellation
   - Small dt (1e-10) works correctly

3. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Empty models: Time advances normally
   - Disabled transitions: Don't interfere
   - Zero dt: No advancement (correct)
   - Large dt: Handled without overflow

4. **Monotonicity**
   - With positive dt, time always increases
   - No unexpected decreases

### What Was Fixed 🔧

1. **Input Validation** (Was broken, now fixed)
   - ✅ Negative dt now raises ValueError
   - ✅ Warning added for large dt > 1.0
   - Improvement: Could add NaN/Inf checks

### What Still Needs Testing 🔄

1. **Transition Type Behaviors**
   - Immediate: Partial testing done
   - Timed: Tests written, need API migration
   - Stochastic: Not yet tested
   - Continuous: Tests written, need API migration

2. **Hybrid Execution**
   - Mixed transition types in one model
   - Execution order verification
   - State snapshot correctness

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Full simulation scenarios
   - Long-running simulations
   - Complex models

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Code Changes Made

**File:** `src/shypn/engine/simulation/controller.py`

**Location:** `step()` method (line ~342)

**Change:**
```python
# Added validation after dt resolution:
if time_step < 0:
    raise ValueError(f"time_step must be non-negative, got {time_step}")

# Added warning:
if time_step > 1.0:
    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.warning(f"Large time step ({time_step}s) may cause timed transitions to miss firing windows")
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents time from going backwards
- Warns users about potentially problematic large steps
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All existing tests still pass
