# Test Status Summary

**Last Updated:** October 8, 2025  
**Overall Status:** 61/63 tests passing (97%)

## Test Suites Overview

### ✅ Phase Integration Tests: 25/25 (100%)

**Purpose:** Validate integration of behavior classes with simulation controller

| Suite | Tests | Pass | Status |
|-------|-------|------|--------|
| Phase 1: Behavior Integration | 7 | 7 | ✅ 100% |
| Phase 2: Conflict Resolution | 7 | 7 | ✅ 100% |
| Phase 3: Time-Aware Behavior | 6 | 6 | ✅ 100% |
| Phase 4: Continuous Integration | 5 | 5 | ✅ 100% |

**Run Command:**
```bash
pytest tests/test_phase*.py -v
```

**Recent Fix:** Updated tests to match exhaustive immediate firing semantics (see `PHASE_TESTS_EXHAUSTIVE_FIRING_FIX.md`)

---

### ✅ Time Computation Tests: 36/38 (95%)

**Purpose:** Validate time handling, transition timing, and integration accuracy

| Suite | Tests | Pass | Skip | Xfail | Status |
|-------|-------|------|------|-------|--------|
| Basic Time Advancement | 12 | 12 | 0 | 0 | ✅ 100% |
| Immediate Transitions | 6 | 6 | 0 | 0 | ✅ 100% |
| Timed Transitions | 9 | 7 | 1 | 1 | ⚠️ 78% |
| Continuous Transitions | 11 | 11 | 0 | 0 | ✅ 100% |

**Run Command:**
```bash
pytest tests/test_time_*.py -v
```

**Details:**
- ✅ **36 passing** - Core functionality verified
- ⏭️ **1 skipped** - Zero-width window edge case (requires controller work)
- ❌ **1 xfailed** - Known bug with workaround
  1. Window skipping with large dt (partial fix in place)

**Recent Fix:** Bug #3 (Continuous overflow) fixed - flow now clamped to available tokens

**Documentation:** See `TIME_COMPUTATION_FINAL_STATUS.md`

---

## Known Issues

### Bug #1: Negative Time Steps ✅ FIXED

**Status:** Resolved  
**Fix:** Added validation in `controller.step()`
```python
if time_step < 0:
    raise ValueError(f"time_step must be non-negative, got {time_step}")
```

---

### Bug #2: Timed Window Skipping ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Status:** Behavior-level detection complete, controller integration pending  
**Affected Tests:** 2 (1 skip, 1 xfail)

**Issue:** When `earliest == latest` (zero-width window), large time steps can skip the exact firing point.

**Current State:**
- ✅ TimedBehavior detects window crossings
- ✅ Returns `(True, 'window-crossed-during-step')`
- ❌ Controller doesn't fire all transitions that return can_fire() = True

**Next Step:** Investigate controller's discrete transition selection algorithm

---

### Bug #3: Continuous Overflow ✅ FIXED

**Status:** Resolved (October 8, 2025)  
**Affected Tests:** Was 1 xfail, now passing

**Issue:** Continuous transitions transferred more tokens than available
```python
# P1 has 5 tokens, rate = 1000 tokens/second, dt = 1.0
# OLD: transfer = 1000 tokens → P1 = -995 ❌
# NEW: transfer = min(1000, 5) = 5 tokens → P1 = 0 ✅
```

**Fix Applied:** Flow clamped before consumption
```python
# Calculate intended flow
intended_flow = rate * dt

# Clamp to available tokens (all input arcs)
actual_flow = intended_flow
for arc in input_arcs:
    max_flow_from_arc = source_place.tokens / arc.weight
    actual_flow = min(actual_flow, max_flow_from_arc)

# Use clamped flow
consumption = arc.weight * actual_flow  # Guaranteed safe
```

**Result:** +1 test passing (36/38 = 95%)  
**Documentation:** See `BUGFIX_CONTINUOUS_OVERFLOW.md`
