# Master Palette Monolithic Refactor - Status Report

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: ❌ **FAILED - Architecture Invalid**  
**Critical Finding**: Monolithic architecture causes Wayland Error 71

---

## Executive Summary

The monolithic refactor was based on a **false premise**. We believed widget reparenting and separate panel windows caused Wayland Error 71, so we designed a monolithic architecture to avoid this. Testing revealed the opposite is true:

- ✅ **Original architecture (separate windows + reparenting) = NO Error 71**
- ❌ **New monolithic architecture (embedded panels) = IMMEDIATE Error 71**

**The attach/detach mechanism was never the problem.**

---

## What Was Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Main Window UI Rebuild (COMPLETE)
- Created new main_window.ui with monolithic structure
- Master Palette slot (48px width for 32x32 icons)
- GtkRevealer (slide-right, 250ms) + GtkStack (no transition)
- 4 panel containers: files (300px), analyses (350px), pathways (320px), topology (400px)
- Removed HeaderBar toggle buttons
- **Files saved**: 
  - `archive/refactor_main/main_window.ui.backup` (original)
  - `archive/refactor_main/main_window.ui.monolithic_structure_only` (Phase 1 result)

### ✅ Phase 2: Panel Content Migration (COMPLETE)
- Created migration script: `scripts/migrate_panels_to_monolithic.py`
- Successfully extracted widget hierarchies from old panel .ui files
- Successfully extracted referenced objects (GtkAdjustment, GtkListStore, etc.)
- Renamed conflicting IDs (status_bar, panel_header)
- Updated object references to use renamed IDs
- **Migrated content**:
  - Files panel: 11 widgets from left_panel.ui
  - Analyses panel: 1 widget from right_panel.ui
  - Pathways panel: 1 widget + 2 GtkAdjustment from pathway_panel.ui
  - Topology panel: 2 widgets from topology_panel.ui
- **Files saved**:
  - `archive/refactor_main/main_window.ui.monolithic_with_migrated_content` (Phase 2 result)

### ⚠️ Phase 3: Master Palette Integration (BLOCKED)
- Created MainWindowController class
- Created 4 panel controller classes (FilesPanelController, AnalysesPanelController, etc.)
- Implemented signal wiring for Master Palette buttons
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to Wayland Error 71

### ❌ Phase 4-6: NOT STARTED
- Controller integration
- Startup state configuration
- Cleanup deprecated code

## The Wayland Error 71 Investigation

### Testing Methodology

We systematically disabled components to isolate the cause:

1. **Test 1**: Disabled Files panel only → **Error 71**
2. **Test 2**: Disabled ALL panels → **Error 71**
3. **Test 3**: Disabled ALL panel controllers → **Error 71**
4. **Test 4**: Disabled Master Palette insertion → **Error 71**
5. **Test 5**: Disabled MainWindowController initialization → **Error 71**
6. **Test 6**: Disabled Master Palette creation entirely → **Error 71**
7. **Test 7**: Used empty panels (no migrated content) → **Error 71**
8. **Test 8**: Used original main_window.ui with old architecture → **NO Error 71** ✅

### Critical Discovery

**Error 71 occurs when:**
- `USE_MASTER_PALETTE = True` (regardless of what's actually enabled)
- Using new main_window.ui (with panels_stack instead of left_dock_stack)
- At the exact moment `on_activate()` returns to `app.run()`

**Error 71 does NOT occur when:**
- `USE_MASTER_PALETTE = False`
- Using original main_window.ui
- **Even with all the separate panel windows and widget reparenting!**

### Error 71 Timeline

```
[INIT] Connected minimize button
[INIT] Connected maximize button
[INIT] Setting up delete-event handler...
[INIT] delete-event handler connected
[INIT] Initialization complete, about to start GTK main loop...
[INIT] on_activate() completed successfully, returning to app.run()...
Gdk-Message: 14:40:26.417: Error 71 (Protocol error) dispatching to Wayland display.
```

The error happens AFTER `on_activate()` returns, when GTK tries to realize/present the window.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Triggers Error 71

The Wayland protocol error is triggered by **something in the new main_window.ui structure itself**, NOT by:
- Panel content (tested with empty panels)
- Master Palette widget (tested with it disabled)
- Panel controllers (tested with them disabled)
- Widget reparenting (the old architecture doesn't have this issue!)

### Suspected Causes

1. **GtkRevealer + GtkStack interaction**: This combination might trigger Wayland surface management issues
2. **Window realization timing**: We call `window.realize()` early, then `show_all()`, which might conflict with GtkRevealer's `reveal-child=False` state
3. **Widget visibility states**: Complex interactions between `visible`, `no-show-all`, and `reveal-child` properties
4. **GTK/Wayland bug**: Possible bug in GTK's Wayland backend with specific widget configurations

### What We Know Works

The **original architecture** with:
- Separate GtkWindow for each panel (left_panel, right_panel, pathway_panel, topology_panel)
- Widget reparenting via `container.remove()` and `container.add()`
- Attach/detach mechanism
- left_dock_stack in main window
- HeaderBar toggle buttons

**Works perfectly with NO Wayland errors.**

### Files in Archive

```
archive/refactor_main/
├── main_window.ui.backup                              # Original (Phase 0)
├── main_window.ui.monolithic_structure_only           # Phase 1 complete

### Migration Script

`scripts/migrate_panels_to_monolithic.py`:
- Extracts widget hierarchies from old .ui files
- Extracts referenced objects (GtkAdjustment, etc.)
- Renames conflicting IDs
- Updates object references
- Embeds content into main_window.ui

**Status**: ✅ Working perfectly (validated with gtk-builder-tool)

### New Classes Created

```
src/shypn/ui/
├── panels/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base_panel.py                    # BasePanel (GObject, no ABC)

## Implications & Recommendations

### The False Premise

**We assumed**: Separate windows + widget reparenting = Wayland Error 71  
**Reality**: Separate windows + widget reparenting = Works perfectly  
**Actual problem**: New monolithic UI structure = Wayland Error 71

### What This Means

1. **The original panel architecture was sound**
   - No fundamental issues with separate windows
   - Attach/detach mechanism is Wayland-compatible
   - Error 71 was likely caused by something else entirely (specific timing issues, dialog handling, etc.)

2. **The monolithic refactor introduced the problem**
   - Trying to "fix" something that wasn't broken
   - Created a worse situation (immediate crash vs occasional issues)

3. **Significant work can be salvaged**
   - Master Palette widget itself is fine
   - Panel controller architecture is sound
   - Migration script is useful for other purposes

### Path Forward: Two Options

#### Option A: Fix the Monolithic Architecture (HIGH RISK)

**Approach**: Debug the Wayland Error 71 in the new UI structure

**Pros**:
- Salvages all Phase 1-3 work
- Cleaner architecture if it works
- No separate windows to manage

**Cons**:
- Root cause is unclear (could be GTK/Wayland bug)
- May be unfixable without GTK changes
- Already spent significant time debugging
- Risk of never finding solution

**Effort**: Unknown (could be hours or weeks)

#### Option B: Hybrid Architecture (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

**Approach**: Keep separate panel windows, use Master Palette to control them

**Design**:
```
Master Palette Button Click
    ↓
calls panel_loader.attach_to(left_dock_stack)
    ↓
Panel window content moves to main window
    ↓
Works perfectly (already validated!)
```

**Pros**:
- Uses proven, working mechanism
- Master Palette integration is straightforward
- Can reuse existing panel loaders
- Lower risk, faster completion
- Salvages Master Palette widget and concept

**Cons**:
- Separate panel windows still exist (but hidden when attached)
- Slightly more complex state management
- Phase 1-2 work becomes reference only

**Effort**: 2-4 hours

## Metrics

### Time Invested
- **Phase 1 (UI Rebuild)**: ~3 hours
- **Phase 2 (Content Migration)**: ~4 hours
- **Phase 3 (Integration)**: ~2 hours
- **Error 71 Debugging**: ~5 hours
- **Total**: ~14 hours

### Code Changes
- **New files created**: 8
- **Modified files**: 4
- **Lines of code**: ~1,200
- **Documentation**: 10 markdown files

### Test Results
- ✅ UI validation: PASS (gtk-builder-tool)
- ✅ Panel content migration: PASS
- ✅ Widget reference updates: PASS
- ❌ Application startup: FAIL (Error 71)
- ❌ Wayland compatibility: FAIL

---

## Conclusion

The monolithic refactor **cannot proceed** in its current form due to Wayland Error 71. The error is triggered by the new main_window.ui structure itself, not by any code logic or panel content.

**The original architecture with separate panel windows works correctly and should be retained.**

**Recommended action**: Pivot to **Option B (Hybrid Architecture)** - integrate Master Palette with the existing, working panel system.
