## What Was Analyzed

Comprehensive analysis of how time is computed and advanced during Petri net simulation in ShyPN, covering:

1. **Time Architecture** - Time representation, sources, and flow
2. **Advancement Mechanisms** - Discrete steps, continuous integration, event scheduling
3. **Time-Critical Components** - Controller, behaviors, settings, state tracking
4. **Critical Scenarios** - Zero-time, fixed delay, hybrid execution, scheduling
5. **Edge Cases** - Boundaries, precision, errors, conflicts
6. **Test Plan** - 7 test suites with 50+ test cases

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Time Representation

**Two Time Systems:**
- **Logical Time** (`controller.time`): Simulation clock (float, seconds)
- **Wall-Clock Time**: Real elapsed time (for UI only)

**Master Clock:** `SimulationController.time`
- Starts at 0.0
- Advances by `dt` (time_step) each simulation step
- Independent of wall-clock time

### 2. Time Advancement

**Fixed Time Steps:**
```python
def step(self, time_step=None):
    if time_step is None:
        time_step = self.get_effective_dt()  # From settings
    
    # ... execute transitions ...
    
    self.time += time_step  # Always advances!
```

**dt Calculation:**
- **Auto mode:** `dt = duration / target_steps` (default: 1000 steps)
- **Manual mode:** `dt = user_specified_value`

### 3. Hybrid Execution Model

**Execution Order (per step):**
```
1. EXHAUST Immediate Transitions (zero time, max 1000 iterations)
2. SNAPSHOT Continuous Transitions (which are enabled at time t)
3. FIRE ONE Discrete Transition (timed or stochastic)
4. INTEGRATE ALL Continuous Transitions (over dt interval)
5. ADVANCE TIME (t = t + dt)
6. NOTIFY LISTENERS (UI updates)
```

**Critical Design:** Continuous uses state **before** discrete firing (snapshot approach)

### 4. Transition Timing

| Type | Timing Behavior |
|------|----------------|
| **Immediate** | Zero time, exhaustive firing in one step |
| **Timed** | Window [enablement + earliest, enablement + latest] |
| **Stochastic** | Exponential delay: `delay ~ Exp(rate)` |
| **Continuous** | Smooth integration: `Δtokens = rate * dt` |

### 5. Critical Issues Identified

| Issue | Severity | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Large dt misses timed windows** | 🔴 HIGH | Transitions never fire |
| **No negative dt validation** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Time can go backwards |
| **Floating-point accumulation** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Precision loss over time |
| **No warning for extreme dt** | 🟢 LOW | Performance degradation |
| **Immediate loop only logs** | 🟢 LOW | May appear as hang |

### 6. Time-Critical Components

**SimulationController:**
- Master time: `self.time`
- Time step: `get_effective_dt()`
- Progress tracking: `calculate_progress()`
- Completion check: `is_simulation_complete()`

**TransitionBehavior:**
- Time access: `_get_current_time()`
- Enablement tracking: `set_enablement_time(t)`
- Timing checks: `can_fire()` → considers elapsed time

**SimulationSettings:**
- Duration management
- dt calculation (auto/manual)
- Progress computation

**TransitionState:**
- `enablement_time`: When became enabled
- `scheduled_time`: When should fire (stochastic)

## Recommendations

### Short-Term (Next Sprint)

1. **Add dt validation**
   ```python
   if time_step < 0:
       raise ValueError("time_step must be non-negative")
   ```

2. **Warn about large dt**
   ```python
   if time_step > 1.0:
       logger.warning("Large dt may miss timed windows")
   ```

3. **Use epsilon comparisons**
   ```python
   EPSILON = 1e-9
   if abs(t - target) < EPSILON:
       # Close enough (handle floating-point precision)
   ```

### Medium-Term (Future Release)

4. **Adaptive dt** - Adjust step size for scheduled events
5. **Next-event scheduling** - Jump to next event time
6. **Better loop detection** - Error instead of warning

### Long-Term (Research)

7. **Higher-order integration** - RK4 for continuous transitions
8. **Hybrid time-stepping** - Combine fixed + event-driven

## Critical Time Scenarios Documented

### Zero-Time Firing (Immediate)
- Multiple transitions fire in **same time point**
- No time advance during exhaustion
- Max 1000 iterations to prevent infinite loops

### Fixed Delay (Timed)
- Window: `[enablement + earliest, enablement + latest]`
- Inclusive boundaries: can fire AT earliest and latest
- Re-enablement **resets** window (not cumulative)
- **Risk:** Large dt can jump over entire window!

### Exponential Delay (Stochastic)
- Sample delay: `delay ~ Exp(rate)`
- Mean delay: `1/rate`
- Fires when `current_time >= scheduled_time`
- Re-enablement samples **new** delay

### Smooth Integration (Continuous)
- Forward Euler: `Δtokens = rate * weight * dt`
- Rate evaluated at **start** of step
- Multiple continuous transitions integrate **in parallel**
- Uses snapshot from **before** discrete firing

### Hybrid Execution
- **Order matters:** Immediate → Discrete → Continuous
- Continuous snapshot taken **before** discrete changes
- All steps happen **within one dt interval**
- Time advances **once** at end
