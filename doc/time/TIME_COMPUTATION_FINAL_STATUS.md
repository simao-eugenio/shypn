## Bugs Summary

### Bug #1: Negative Time Steps (FIXED ✅)

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**File:** `src/shypn/engine/simulation/controller.py`  
**Line:** ~342

**Issue:**
Negative time steps were accepted, causing time to go backwards.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
def step(self, time_step=None):
    if time_step is None:
        time_step = self.get_effective_dt()
    
    # Validate time step
    if time_step < 0:
        raise ValueError(f"time_step must be non-negative, got {time_step}")
    
    # Warn about large steps
    if time_step > 1.0:
        logger.warning(f"Large time step ({time_step}s) may cause "
                      f"timed transitions to miss firing windows")
    
    self.time += time_step
```

**Result:** Time can no longer go backwards. Test `test_negative_time_step_rejected` now passes.

### Bug #2: Timed Window Skipping (DOCUMENTED ⚠️)

**Status:** ⚠️ DOCUMENTED (Partial fix attempted)  
**Severity:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Tests Affected:** 
- `test_window_with_large_dt_may_miss` (xfail)
- `test_earliest_equals_latest_fixed_delay` (skipped)

**Issue:**
Large time steps can skip over narrow timing windows completely. When `earliest == latest`, you have a zero-width window that's easily missed.

**Example:**
```python
# Transition: earliest=2.0, latest=2.0 (width=0)
# Time steps: 0.0 → 0.9 → 1.8 → 2.1
# Window at exactly 2.0 is skipped!

At t=1.8: elapsed=1.8, too early (< 2.0)
At t=2.1: elapsed=2.1, too late (> 2.0)
→ Transition never fires!
```

**Attempted Fix:**
Added state tracking in `TimedBehavior`:
```python
# In __init__:
self._was_too_early = False
self._was_in_window = False

# In can_fire():
if elapsed < self.earliest:
    self._was_too_early = True
    return (False, 'too-early')

if elapsed > self.latest:
    # Detect window crossing
    if self._was_too_early and not self._was_in_window:
        return (True, 'window-crossed-during-step')
    return (False, 'too-late')
```

**Partial Success:**
- ✅ `TimedBehavior.can_fire()` correctly detects window crossing
- ✅ Returns `True` with reason `'window-crossed-during-step'`
- ❌ Controller doesn't select transition for firing
- ❌ Tokens don't transfer despite `can_fire()` returning `True`

**Root Cause:**
The issue is in the **SimulationController**'s discrete transition selection logic, not in TimedBehavior. The behavior correctly reports it can fire, but the controller's scheduling algorithm doesn't fire it.

**Recommended Complete Fix:**
Requires investigation and modification of `SimulationController` discrete transition selection:
1. Check how controller queries `can_fire()` during discrete phase
2. Verify transition selection when multiple transitions return `True`
3. Ensure "window-crossed" transitions are prioritized
4. May need to store and retry crossed transitions

**Workaround:**
Use smaller time steps (dt) relative to timing windows:
- For window width `w`, use `dt <= w/2`
- For `earliest == latest`, use very small `dt` (e.g., 0.01)

### Bug #3: Continuous Overflow (DOCUMENTED ⚠️)

**Status:** ⚠️ DOCUMENTED  
**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Test:** `test_very_large_rate` (xfail)

**Issue:**
Continuous transitions transfer `rate * dt` tokens without checking source availability. Results in negative token counts or over-transfer.

**Example:**
```python
P1 has 5 tokens
rate = 1000 tokens/second
dt = 1.0
transfer = 1000 * 1.0 = 1000 tokens (!)

Result:
  P1 = 5 - 1000 = -995 (negative!)
  P2 = 0 + 1000 = 1000 (more than available!)
```

**Expected Behavior:**
```python
transfer = min(rate * dt, available_tokens)
```

**Recommended Fix:**
In `ContinuousBehavior.fire()`:
```python
# Calculate intended transfer
intended_amount = rate * dt

# Clamp to available tokens
for arc in input_arcs:
    source_place = self._get_place(arc.source_id)
    available = source_place.tokens
    max_transfer_this_arc = available / arc.weight
    intended_amount = min(intended_amount, max_transfer_this_arc)

# Transfer the clamped amount
actual_amount = intended_amount
```

**Impact:** Medium - affects models with high rates or limited tokens

## Infrastructure Added

### TimedBehavior Window Crossing Detection

Added state tracking for future fix completion:

**New Attributes:**
```python
self._was_too_early = False  # True if we've been checked while too early
self._was_in_window = False  # True if we've been in the firing window
```

**Updated Methods:**
- `__init__()`: Initialize state flags
- `clear_enablement()`: Reset state flags
- `can_fire()`: Track state transitions and detect crossings

**Benefits:**
- Foundation for complete fix
- Clear state machine for window timing
- Easy to extend for controller-level solution

**Status:** Infrastructure ready, needs controller integration

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **State-Based Detection:** Using boolean flags (`_was_too_early`, `_was_in_window`) is cleaner than time-based tracking
2. **Debug Scripts:** Creating dedicated debug files helped isolate the issue
3. **Incremental Testing:** Testing each change immediately caught issues fast

### What Didn't Work

1. **Time-Based Tracking:** `_last_check_time` approach failed because `can_fire()` is called multiple times per step
2. **Behavior-Only Fix:** The issue requires controller-level changes, not just behavior changes
3. **Complex Logic:** Initial epsilon-based comparisons were fragile and hard to debug

### Key Insight

**The problem is architectural:** The `TimedBehavior` correctly identifies when it can fire, but the `SimulationController`'s discrete transition selection algorithm doesn't guarantee that all fireable transitions actually fire. This is a scheduling/arbitration issue, not a behavior enablement issue.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Investigate Controller Discrete Transition Selection**
   - File: `src/shypn/engine/simulation/controller.py`
   - Method: Discrete transition phase logic
   - Question: How are transitions selected when multiple return `can_fire() == True`?
   - Question: Is there random selection? Priority ordering?

2. **Test Controller Behavior**
   - Create test with 2+ timed transitions in different states
   - Verify all fireable transitions actually fire
   - Check if "window-crossed" transitions are treated differently

3. **Complete Timed Window Fix**
   - Option A: Modify controller to always fire "window-crossed" transitions
   - Option B: Add urgency flag to force immediate firing
   - Option C: Queue crossed transitions for guaranteed execution

### Short-term

4. **Fix Continuous Overflow (Bug #3)**
   - Add clamping logic in `ContinuousBehavior.fire()`
   - Verify with `test_very_large_rate`
   - Should be straightforward 1-hour fix

5. **Add Controller Tests**
   - Test multiple fireable transitions
   - Test transition selection algorithm
   - Test priority and ordering

### Medium-term

6. **Phase 2: Integration Tests**
   - Hybrid models (all transition types)
   - Complex state machines
   - Full simulation scenarios

7. **Optimization**
   - Profile `can_fire()` call frequency
   - Consider caching enablement state
   - Optimize hot paths
