# Time Computation Testing - Final Summary

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 Partially Complete - Critical Work Done  
**Result:** ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED** + 19 Tests Passing

---

## 🎉 Major Achievements

### 1. ✅ **Critical Bug Discovered and Fixed**

**The Bug:**
- **Negative time steps were accepted**, causing time to go backwards
- No validation in `SimulationController.step()` method
- Could cause serious simulation corruption

**The Fix:**
```python
# Added to SimulationController.step():
if time_step < 0:
    raise ValueError(f"time_step must be non-negative, got {time_step}")

# Also added safety warning:
if time_step > 1.0:
    logger.warning("Large time step may cause timed transitions to miss firing windows")
```

**Impact:** This was a **critical safety issue** that is now resolved.

## 🔍 Technical Insights

### What We Learned

1. **Time Advancement is Solid**
   - Core mechanism (`self.time += dt`) works perfectly
   - Accumulation is accurate
   - Floating-point precision is excellent

2. **Immediate Transitions Work Perfectly**
   - Zero-time firing confirmed
   - Exhaustive execution works
   - Safety mechanisms in place

3. **Timed Transitions are Probabilistic**
   - Fire randomly within [earliest, latest] window
   - Need multiple steps to guarantee firing
   - Properties must be in `transition.properties` dict

4. **API Migration Pattern**
   ```python
   # Old (doesn't exist):
   model = PetriNetModel()
   p = model.add_place("P1", initial_tokens=1)
   
   # New (correct):
   model = ModelCanvasManager()
   p = model.add_place(x=100, y=100, label="P1")
   p.tokens = 1
   p.initial_marking = 1
   
   # For timed transitions:
   t = model.add_transition(x=200, y=100, label="T1")
   t.transition_type = 'timed'
   if not hasattr(t, 'properties'):
       t.properties = {}
   t.properties['earliest'] = 1.0
   t.properties['latest'] = 2.0
   ```
