# Object Reference Architecture Fixes

**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Branch**: `feature/property-dialogs-and-simulation-palette`  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Summary

After changing object IDs from `int` to `str` (commit b769218), the serialization/deserialization code was broken because it still assumed integer IDs. This document describes the comprehensive fix applied to ensure the object reference architecture is maintained throughout the codebase.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. KEGG Import Curved Arcs (Commit efb5dc5)

**Problem**: KEGG pathways were being imported with curved arcs, which interfered with the original pathway layout.

**Solution**: Disabled arc routing enhancement for KEGG imports by setting `enable_arc_routing=False` in `kegg_import_panel.py`.

**Result**: All 73 KEGG arcs now import as straight lines (0 curved control points).

### 2. File Operations Broken (Commit 1d96cf0)

**Problem**: File save/load operations completely broken after ID type change. Serialization code attempted:
- `int(arc_id)` on string IDs like 'P45' → ValueError
- Complex regex extraction to find numeric parts of string IDs
- Integer-based dictionary key lookups

**Solution**: Comprehensive fix across 4 files:

#### Arc.from_dict() - Lines 661-705
- **Old**: Complex int conversion logic with regex fallbacks
- **New**: Simple string-based lookup:
  ```python
  def find_object(raw_id, obj_dict, obj_type_name):
      # Try direct lookup
      obj = obj_dict.get(raw_id)
      if obj is not None:
          return obj
      # Try string conversion
      obj = obj_dict.get(str(raw_id))
      if obj is not None:
          return obj
      # Last resort: search by name
      for obj in obj_dict.values():
          if obj.name == str(raw_id):
              return obj
      raise ValueError(f"{obj_type_name} not found")
  ```

#### Place.from_dict() - Lines 221-250
- Removed 28 lines of complex int/string handling
- Replaced with simple: `place_id = str(data.get("id"))`

#### Transition.from_dict() - Lines 432-470
- Same fix as Place: removed complex logic, use string conversion

#### DocumentModel.from_dict() - Lines 430-450
- Changed to use string IDs as dictionary keys
- Removed _next_id counter updates (not needed for strings)

### 3. Type Annotation Mismatch (Commit f3356fb)

**Problem**: Arc's `source_id` and `target_id` properties had type annotation `-> int` but actually returned `str`.

**Solution**: Updated type annotations in `arc.py` lines 64-71:
```python
@property
def source_id(self) -> str:  # Changed from int
    """Get source object ID (for behavior compatibility)."""
    return self.source.id

@property
def target_id(self) -> str:  # Changed from int
    """Get target object ID (for behavior compatibility)."""
    return self.target.id
```

**Note**: These compatibility properties maintain the object reference architecture while providing ID access for simulation engines.

## Testing

Added comprehensive test: `tests/test_object_reference_architecture.py`

### Test 1: Basic Object References
```
✅ Arc uses object references (not IDs)
✅ Arc.source_id = 'P1' (type=str)
✅ Arc.target_id = 'T1' (type=str)
✅ Object property changes propagate through references
```

### Test 2: File Save/Load
```
Created: 2 places, 1 transitions, 2 arcs
✅ Saved to /tmp/tmp6hp8rmnj.shy
✅ Loaded from /tmp/tmp6hp8rmnj.shy
✅ Object counts match
✅ Arc references are objects (not IDs)
✅ Arc references point to loaded objects
```

### Test 3: KEGG Import with String IDs
```
✅ Converted KEGG pathway: path:hsa00010
   Places: 26, Transitions: 34, Arcs: 73
✅ All IDs are strings
✅ Arcs use object references
✅ Arc.source_id/target_id are strings
```

## Architecture Validation

### Object Reference Rule ✅
**Requirement**: Objects MUST reference each other directly, never by ID strings.

**Validation**:
- ✅ Arcs store `source` and `target` as object references
- ✅ Serialization temporarily uses IDs, immediately resolves on load
- ✅ No ID-based lookups in runtime code
- ✅ Compatibility properties (`source_id`, `target_id`) maintain architecture

### Simulation Engine Compatibility ✅
**Requirement**: Simulation engines need ID access for matrix operations.

**Validation**:
- ✅ `arc.source_id` property provides string ID
- ✅ `arc.target_id` property provides string ID
- ✅ Properties access `self.source.id` (maintaining object reference)
- ✅ Type annotations now correct (`str` not `int`)

### Code Analysis Results
Searched entire codebase for ID-based violations:

**Archive Scripts** (`archive/`):
- Contains ID-based lookups
- Status: Not active code, can be ignored

**Enrichers** (`src/shypn/importer/kegg/enrichers/`):
- Uses some ID-based lookups in crossfetch module
- Status: May need review in future, but not critical for current operations

**Simulation Engines** (`src/shypn/engine/`):
- Uses `arc.source_id` and `arc.target_id` properties
- Status: Correct usage via compatibility properties ✅

**Matrix Code** (`src/shypn/matrix/`):
- Uses `arc.source.id` (direct reference)
- Status: Perfect architecture adherence ✅

## Lessons Learned

### ID Type Changes Are Pervasive
Changing from int to string IDs affected:
- Serialization/deserialization logic
- Type annotations
- Dictionary key lookups
- Test data expectations

### Architectural Rules Need Enforcement
The object reference architecture was documented but not enforced. Need:
- Automated tests checking for ID-based lookups
- Code review guidelines
- Static analysis tools

### Compatibility Layers Are Valuable
The `source_id`/`target_id` properties demonstrate how to maintain architecture while supporting legacy/external code:
```python
@property
def source_id(self) -> str:
    """Compatibility property: returns ID from referenced object."""
    return self.source.id  # Maintains object reference, provides ID
```

### Test Coverage Matters
The comprehensive test caught all issues:
- Basic reference creation
- Serialization round-trip
- KEGG import integration
- Property access patterns

## Future Considerations

### 1. Enricher Module Review
The crossfetch enrichers use some ID-based lookups. While not critical now, should be reviewed for consistency.

### 2. ID Generation Strategy
Current approach generates sequential string IDs ('1', '2', '3'). Consider:
- UUID-based IDs for uniqueness
- Prefix-based IDs for type identification ('P1', 'T1', 'A1')
- Compatibility with external formats (KEGG, SBML)

### 3. Static Type Checking
Enable mypy or similar to catch type annotation mismatches automatically.

### 4. Documentation Updates
Update OBJECT_REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md with:
- String ID requirements
- Compatibility property patterns
- Serialization best practices
