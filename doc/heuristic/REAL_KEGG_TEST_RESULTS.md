# Real KEGG Pathway Test Results

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Pathway**: Glycolysis (hsa00010)  
**Test**: Integration with kinetics enhancement system

## Test Results

### ✅ Test PASSED

Successfully tested kinetics enhancement with real KEGG pathway import from KEGG database.

### Pathway Statistics

- **Pathway**: path:hsa00010 (Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis)
- **Entries**: 101 (genes, compounds, reactions)
- **Reactions**: 34 biochemical reactions
- **Conversion**:
  - Places: 26 (compounds)
  - Transitions: 34 (reactions)
  - Arcs: 73 (connections)

### Enhancement Results

```
Enhancement Statistics:
  - Total transitions: 34
  - Enhanced: 34/34 (100%)

Confidence Distribution:
  - Low: 34

Rules Applied:
  - simple_mass_action: 34
```

## Analysis

### Why All Low Confidence?

The KGML format from KEGG does not include EC numbers directly in the reaction XML. Therefore:

1. **No EC Numbers Detected**: The reactions lack explicit enzyme annotations in KGML
2. **Correct Fallback**: System correctly applied `simple_mass_action` rule
3. **Appropriate Confidence**: Low confidence is correct for reactions without enzyme data
4. **100% Enhancement**: All transitions were enhanced (no existing kinetic laws)

### Reaction Structure

Sample reaction from Glycolysis:
```
Reaction: rn:R00710
  Type: reversible
  Substrates: 1
    - 105 (cpd:C00084) x1
  Products: 1
    - 45 (cpd:C00033) x1
```

**Attributes Available**:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Reaction ID (e.g., rn:R00710)
- `type`: "reversible" or "irreversible"
- `substrates`: List of KEGGSubstrate objects
- `products`: List of KEGGProduct objects

**Missing**:
- No `ec_number` attribute
- No explicit enzyme information
- No kinetic law parameters

This is expected - KGML is a pathway topology format, not a kinetic model format.

## Enhancement Behavior

### What Happened

For each of the 34 reactions:

1. **Detection Phase**:
   - Check for EC number → Not found
   - Check for existing kinetic law → None
   - Check reaction structure → Simple (1-2 substrates)

2. **Assignment Phase**:
   - No enzyme detected → Not enzymatic
   - Simple structure → Apply `simple_mass_action`
   - Estimate rate constant k
   - Set confidence to `low` (no enzyme data)

3. **Result**:
   - Type: `continuous` (default for mass action)
   - Rule: `simple_mass_action`
   - Source: `heuristic`
   - Confidence: `low`
   - Rate function: `k * substrate1 * substrate2 * ...`

### Example Transition

```
Transition: R00710
  Type: continuous
  Source: heuristic
  Confidence: low
  Rule: simple_mass_action
  Rate Function: mass_action(substrate_ids, k=1.0)
```

## Verification

### ✅ Integration Working

1. **Import Success**: Fetched real pathway from KEGG API
2. **Parsing Success**: KGML converted to KEGGPathway objects
3. **Conversion Success**: KEGGPathway → PetriNetDocument
4. **Enhancement Success**: All transitions enhanced
5. **Metadata Tracking**: Source, confidence, rule all tracked
6. **KEGG Compatibility**: Fixed format differences work correctly

### ✅ Correct Behavior

The system is behaving **exactly as designed**:

- **No override**: No existing kinetic laws to override
- **Appropriate fallback**: Simple mass action for reactions without enzyme data
- **Honest confidence**: Low confidence because we're guessing
- **Full coverage**: 100% of transitions enhanced

### ✅ Safety Guarantees

- ✅ Didn't crash on real data
- ✅ Handled 34 reactions correctly
- ✅ Proper metadata tracking
- ✅ Reversibility detected correctly
- ✅ Stoichiometry handled properly

## EC Numbers in KEGG

### Why Missing?

KGML (KEGG Markup Language) is a **pathway topology format**, not a detailed kinetic model:

- **Purpose**: Visualize pathway structure
- **Focus**: Which compounds connect to which reactions
- **Granularity**: Network-level, not reaction-level details

EC numbers **are** in KEGG database, but in separate API endpoints:

```python
# To get EC numbers, would need:
from shypn.importer.kegg.api_client import KEGGAPIClient
client = KEGGAPIClient()

# Fetch reaction details (not in KGML)
reaction_info = client.fetch_reaction_info("R00710")
# This would contain EC number: "2.7.1.1" (Hexokinase)
```

### Future Enhancement (Phase 2)

**Plan**: Add EC number lookup via KEGG API

```python
# Phase 2: Database Integration
for reaction in pathway.reactions:
    # 1. Parse reaction ID from name (e.g., "rn:R00710" → "R00710")
    reaction_id = reaction.name.split(':')[1]
    
    # 2. Fetch reaction details from KEGG
    reaction_info = client.fetch_reaction_info(reaction_id)
    
    # 3. Extract EC number
    if reaction_info and reaction_info.get('enzyme'):
        ec_number = reaction_info['enzyme'][0]  # e.g., "2.7.1.1"
        
        # 4. Assign with medium/high confidence
        result = assigner.assign(
            transition, reaction, substrates, products,
            ec_number=ec_number,  # NEW
            source='kegg'
        )
        # Result: enzymatic_mm, medium confidence
```

This would increase confidence and accuracy for enzymatic reactions.

## Conclusion

### ✅ Integration Complete and Verified
