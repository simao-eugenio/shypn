# File Analysis: Enrichment Status

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Analysis**: Checking EC enrichment and transition types across multiple Glycolysis files

---

## Files Analyzed

### 1. `workspace/projects/Flow_Test/models/Glycolysis_enriched_Gluconeogenesis.shy`

**Created**: 2025-10-19 03:42 (39 minutes AFTER bug fixes)

**Model Structure**:
- Places: 26
- Transitions: 34
- Arcs: 73

**Transition Types**:
| Type | Count | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| Continuous | 12 | 35.3% |
| Stochastic | 22 | 64.7% |

**EC Enrichment Status**: ‚ùå **NONE**
- Transitions WITH EC numbers: **0**
- Transitions WITHOUT EC numbers: **34**

**Verdict**: Despite being named "enriched", this file has **NO EC enrichment**. This suggests:
1. File was imported with EC enrichment disabled in the UI
2. Or the import failed silently

### 2. `workspace/Test_flow/model/Glycolysis_last_Gluconeogenesis.shy`

**Created**: 2025-10-19 03:34 (30 minutes AFTER bug fixes)

**Model Structure**:
- Places: 26
- Transitions: 39
- Arcs: 78

**Transition Types**:
| Type | Count | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| Continuous | 12 | 30.8% |
| Stochastic | 27 | 69.2% |

**EC Enrichment Status**: ‚ùå **NONE**
- Transitions WITH EC numbers: **0**
- Transitions WITHOUT EC numbers: **39**

**Verdict**: Also has NO EC enrichment despite being created AFTER the bug fixes.

### 3. `workspace/Test_flow/model/Glycolysis_topology_Gluconeogenesis.shy`

**Created**: 2025-10-19 03:12 (8 minutes AFTER first bug fix, 5 minutes BEFORE second fix)

**Not analyzed yet** - Created during the bug fix window.

## Analysis

### Why No EC Numbers?

Even though both files were created AFTER the bug fixes, they have **no EC numbers**. Possible reasons:

1. **EC Enrichment Checkbox Unchecked**
   - The KEGG import dialog has an "Enhance kinetics" checkbox
   - If unchecked, EC numbers won't be fetched
   - Default state might be unchecked

2. **Import from Cached KGML**
   - If importing from pre-downloaded KGML file
   - EC enrichment only works with live KEGG API
   - Offline imports won't have EC numbers

3. **Silent Failure**
   - EC fetching may have failed
   - Error not displayed to user
   - Need to check logs

4. **Old Code Branch**
   - Files might have been created from a branch without the fixes
   - Check: `git log --all --oneline | grep 154f8ba`

---

## Verification Needed

To verify the bug fixes actually work, we need to:

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Check Current Code
```bash
# Verify we're on the right branch
git log --oneline -1

# Should show commit AFTER 358237d
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Import Fresh with EC Enrichment
```python
# In shypn GUI:
1. File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí KEGG Pathway
2. Enter "hsa00010" (Glycolysis)
3. ‚úì CHECK "Enhance kinetics" checkbox  # ‚Üê CRITICAL
4. Import
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify EC Numbers
```python
# Check transitions have EC numbers:
for t in document.transitions:
    if hasattr(t, 'metadata') and 'ec_numbers' in t.metadata:
        print(f"{t.name}: EC {t.metadata['ec_numbers']}")
```

**Expected output**:
```
R00299: EC ['2.7.1.1', '2.7.1.2']  # Hexokinase
R01068: EC ['5.3.1.9']              # Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
R00658: EC ['2.7.1.11']             # Phosphofructokinase
...
```

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Verify Transition Types
```python
continuous = [t for t in document.transitions 
              if t.transition_type == 'continuous']
              
continuous_with_ec = [t for t in continuous 
                      if hasattr(t, 'metadata') 
                      and 'ec_numbers' in t.metadata]

print(f"Continuous: {len(continuous)}")
print(f"With EC: {len(continuous_with_ec)}")
print(f"Success: {len(continuous_with_ec) == len(continuous)}")
```

**Expected**: All continuous transitions should have EC numbers

---

## Next Steps

1. **Re-import KEGG pathway** with EC enrichment enabled
2. **Save with descriptive name**: `Glycolysis_VERIFIED_ENRICHED.shy`
3. **Analyze new file** to confirm:
   - ‚úÖ Transitions have EC numbers in metadata
   - ‚úÖ Continuous transitions have Michaelis-Menten kinetics
   - ‚úÖ HIGH confidence from database lookup
   - ‚úÖ Enzyme names populated

4. **Document successful enrichment** for future reference

---

## Conclusion

**Current Status**: ‚ùå **NO files have EC enrichment yet**

Despite being created after the bug fixes, both analyzed files have:
- 0% enrichment rate
- No EC numbers in metadata
- No enzyme names
- No kinetics confidence levels

**Likely Cause**: EC enrichment checkbox was not checked during import

**Solution**: Re-import with "Enhance kinetics" checkbox enabled

**Verification**: Look for:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "ec_numbers": ["2.7.1.1", "2.7.1.2"],
    "enzyme_name": "Hexokinase",
    "kinetics_confidence": "high",
    "kinetics_source": "database"
  }
}
```

**Status**: üîç **NEEDS VERIFICATION**  
**Action**: Re-import KEGG pathway with EC enrichment enabled to verify bug fixes work
