# Physics Terminology Update - Force-Directed Layout

**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and ready for testing

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Correct Physics Terminology

**OLD (vague):**
- Nodes repel
- Edges attract
- Edge weights

**NEW (precise):**
- **Mass nodes**: Places and Transitions (repel each other via electrostatic force)
- **Springs**: Arcs (attract connected mass nodes via Hooke's law)
- **Spring strength**: Arc weight/stoichiometry (e.g., 2A ‚Üí 2√ó stronger spring)

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/shypn/edit/graph_layout/engine.py`

**Method**: `build_graph()`

**Change**: Now includes arc weights as spring strength:

```python
# Add springs (arcs) with weight as spring strength
for arc in doc.arcs:
    # Arc weight = stoichiometry = spring strength
    # Higher weight = stronger spring = pulls mass nodes closer
    weight = getattr(arc, 'weight', 1.0)  # Default weight = 1.0
    graph.add_edge(arc.source, arc.target, weight=weight, obj=arc)
```

**Impact**: Graph now has edge weights that represent spring strength

---

### 2. `src/shypn/edit/graph_layout/force_directed.py`

**Method**: `compute()`

**Change**: Automatically detects and uses arc weights:

```python
# Check if edges have weights (arc stoichiometry)
has_weights = any('weight' in graph[u][v] for u, v in graph.edges())

if has_weights:
    # Use arc weights as spring strength (stoichiometry-based)
    layout_params['weight'] = 'weight'
    print(f"üî¨ Force-directed: Using arc weights as spring strength")
```

**Impact**: NetworkX spring_layout now uses stoichiometry to calculate spring forces

---

## Physics Model

### Forces in the System

1. **Electrostatic Repulsion** (UNIVERSAL - between ALL mass nodes)
   - **Every mass node repels every other mass node**
   - Place ‚Üî Place: **repel** (like charges)
   - Transition ‚Üî Transition: **repel** (like charges)
   - Place ‚Üî Transition: **repel** (like charges)
   - Force equation: `F_repulsion = -k¬≤ / distance`
   - Purpose: Prevents overlap, creates spacing, pushes disconnected nodes apart
   - This is the "anti-gravity" that keeps all mass nodes separated

2. **Spring Attraction** (SELECTIVE - only via arcs)
   - **Only connected mass nodes attract each other**
   - Springs (arcs) pull connected mass nodes together
   - Force equation: `F_spring = k √ó distance √ó spring_strength`
   - Spring strength = arc weight (stoichiometry)
   - Example: `2A + B ‚Üí C`
     * Spring from A to reaction: strength = 2.0 (2√ó stronger pull)
     * Spring from B to reaction: strength = 1.0 (normal pull)
     * Spring from reaction to C: strength = 1.0 (normal pull)
   - Purpose: Pulls reactants toward reactions, products toward reactions

3. **Equilibrium** (balance of forces)
   - System converges when all forces balance
   - Each mass node settles where: `‚àë F_spring + ‚àë F_repulsion ‚âà 0`
   - Connected nodes: pulled together by springs, pushed apart by repulsion ‚Üí optimal distance
   - Disconnected nodes: only repulsion ‚Üí maximum separation

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Launch and Load

```bash
cd /home/simao/projetos/shypn
python3 -m shypn
```

### 2. Import Pathway

1. **SBML Tab** ‚Üí BioModels ‚Üí BIOMD0000000061
2. Click **Fetch** (downloads pathway)
3. Click **Parse** (loads to canvas with hierarchical layout)
4. **Watch console** for: `üîç QUICK LOAD: Canvas loaded with X places, Y transitions!`

### 3. Apply Force-Directed with Physics

1. **Swiss Palette** button (toolbar or View menu)
2. Click **Layout** category (bottom)
3. Click **Force** button (Force-Directed)
4. **Watch console** for: `üî¨ Force-directed: Using arc weights as spring strength`

### 4. Observe Physics Effects

**Look for:**
- ‚úÖ Higher stoichiometry arcs pull harder (2A closer to reaction than 1B)
- ‚úÖ Mass nodes with many springs cluster together
- ‚úÖ Mass nodes without springs pushed away by repulsion
- ‚úÖ Overall balanced layout (forces in equilibrium)

## Expected Console Output

```
üî¨ Force-directed: Using arc weights as spring strength
Layout algorithm 'force_directed' applied successfully
25 mass nodes repositioned
```

## Physics Parameters (Hardcoded)

These are currently in the ForceDirectedLayout class:

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `iterations` | 500 | Physics simulation steps |
| `k` | auto | Optimal distance between mass nodes (spring rest length) |
| `scale` | 1000.0 | Output coordinate scale (pixels) |
| `threshold` | NetworkX default (1e-4) | Convergence criterion |
| `seed` | 42 | Random seed for reproducibility |

**Note**: The `k` value is auto-calculated as: `k = sqrt(area / num_mass_nodes)`

---

## Comparison: Before vs After

### BEFORE (No Spring Strength)
- All arcs treated equally (uniform spring strength = 1.0)
- `2A + B ‚Üí C` same as `A + B ‚Üí C`
- Layout ignores stoichiometry
- Less chemically meaningful

### AFTER (With Spring Strength)
- Arc weight = spring strength (stoichiometry-based)
- `2A + B ‚Üí C` pulls A 2√ó harder than B
- Layout reflects chemical stoichiometry
- More chemically meaningful
- **A will be positioned closer to the reaction than B**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test with different pathways**
   - Small (BIOMD0000000001, 12 nodes)
   - Medium (BIOMD0000000061, 25 nodes)
   - Large (BIOMD0000000064, 40+ nodes)

2. **Observe stoichiometry effects**
   - Find reactions with high stoichiometry (2A, 3B, etc.)
   - Verify stronger springs pull mass nodes closer
   - Document visual differences

3. **Parameter tuning**
   - Test different `k` values (optimal distance)
   - Test different `iterations` (convergence speed)
   - Test different `scale` (canvas size)
   - Document optimal ranges per pathway size

4. **Create configuration system**
   - Centralize physics parameters in `layout_config.py`
   - Create presets (COMPACT, BALANCED, SPACIOUS)
   - Enable parameter UI controls (future)

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Swiss Palette force-directed uses arc weights  
‚úÖ Console shows "Using arc weights as spring strength"  
‚úÖ Higher stoichiometry ‚Üí stronger spring ‚Üí closer positioning  
‚úÖ Layout reflects chemical stoichiometry  
‚úÖ Physics model is correct (mass nodes + springs)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Ready for empirical testing!**

The force-directed layout now correctly implements the spring-mass physics model with proper terminology and stoichiometry-based spring strength.
