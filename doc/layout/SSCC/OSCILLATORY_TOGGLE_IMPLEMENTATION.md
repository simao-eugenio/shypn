# Implementation Complete: Oscillatory Forces Toggle

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Feature:** Canvas toggle for physics models in Solar System Layout  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

**Implemented a checkbox toggle in the canvas context menu that switches between two physics models:**

1. **Hub Repulsion (Standard)** - Default, Toggle OFF
   - Two forces: Gravity + Coulomb repulsion
   - Strong hub separation (1300-2900 units)
   - Proven stable approach

2. **Oscillatory Forces (Experimental)** - Toggle ON  
   - Single oscillatory force
   - Natural equilibrium (700-1200 units)
   - Spring-like behavior

## 📝 Files Modified

**3 files changed:**

1. **`model_canvas_loader.py`**
   - Added toggle state variable
   - Added checkbox menu item
   - Added toggle handler
   - Updated layout method

2. **`solar_system_layout_engine.py`**
   - Added `use_oscillatory_forces` parameter
   - Conditional simulator selection
   - Updated statistics

3. **`oscillatory_gravitational_simulator.py`**
   - Already implemented (298 lines)

## ✅ Tests

**Integration Test:** ✅ PASSED

```bash
python3 tests/test_oscillatory_integration.py
```

**Results:**
- Both physics models apply layout ✓
- Statistics show correct physics model ✓
- No errors or crashes ✓
- Hub separation working ✓

**Compilation:** ✅ ALL FILES COMPILE

## 🎨 How to Use

**On Canvas:**
1. Right-click background
2. Check/uncheck "☀️ Use Oscillatory Forces (Spring-like)"
3. Apply "Layout: Solar System (SSCC)"
4. See status: "Physics: [model name]"

**Compare both approaches and see which works better!**

## 🚀 Next Step

**Test on canvas with real Petri nets!**

The toggle is fully functional and ready for visual testing.

**Have fun comparing the two physics approaches!** ☀️🌌
