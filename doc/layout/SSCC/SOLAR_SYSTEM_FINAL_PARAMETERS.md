## Calibrated Physics Constants

### Force Strengths

```python
# Arc-based forces (oscillatory attraction/repulsion)
GRAVITY_CONSTANT = 0.15                 # Arc attraction strength
SPRING_CONSTANT = 500.0                 # Arc repulsion when too close
EQUILIBRIUM_SCALE = 10.0                # Base equilibrium distance

# Proximity repulsion (prevents overlap)
PROXIMITY_CONSTANT = 100.0              # Hub-to-hub repulsion strength
PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD = 500.0             # Mass threshold for hub detection
HUB_GROUP_CONSTANT = 500.0             # Hub group center-of-mass repulsion

# Universal repulsion (baseline spacing)
AMBIENT_CONSTANT = 1000.0               # Base repulsion constant
UNIVERSAL_REPULSION_MULTIPLIER = 50.0   # Universal repulsion multiplier
SATELLITE_REPULSION_MULTIPLIER = 0.0    # Extra satellite repulsion (DISABLED)

# Force limits
MAX_FORCE = 100000.0                    # Maximum force per node (critical!)
MIN_DISTANCE = 1.0                      # Minimum distance for calculations
```

### Equilibrium Distance Formula

```python
# For arc from node1 (mass=m1) to node2 (mass=m2) with weight=w:
r_equilibrium = EQUILIBRIUM_SCALE * (m1 + m2)^MASS_EXPONENT * weight^ARC_WEIGHT_EXPONENT
              = 10.0 * (1100)^0.1 * 1.0^-0.3
              ≈ 20 units (theoretical)
# Note: Actual equilibrium at ~850-905 units determined by force balance
```

### Simulation Parameters

```python
TIME_STEP = 0.5                         # Integration time step
DAMPING = 0.9                           # Velocity damping (higher = less damping)
```

## Mass Assignment Strategy

**Hub Transitions (Activity Centers):**
- Mass: 1000
- Criteria: High-degree transitions (degree ≥ 6)
- Role: Gravitational centers that satellites orbit

**Regular Places (Satellites):**
- Mass: 100
- Role: Passive containers that orbit their hub transitions
- Flow: Places → Transitions (biological semantics)

**Mass Ratio: 10:1** (Hub:Satellite)

## Force Types and Their Roles

### 1. Oscillatory Forces (Arc-Based)
**Purpose:** Create orbital patterns

**Behavior:**
- When r > r_eq: Attractive force pulls nodes together
- When r < r_eq: Repulsive force pushes nodes apart
- Creates stable equilibrium at natural orbital distance

**Formula:**
```python
if distance > r_equilibrium:
    # Gravitational attraction
    force = GRAVITY_CONSTANT * m1 * m2 * weight / distance²
else:
    # Spring repulsion
    force = -SPRING_CONSTANT * (r_equilibrium - distance)
```

### 2. Proximity Repulsion (All-Pairs)
**Purpose:** Prevent overlap and separate hubs

**Types:**
1. **Universal base repulsion** (all pairs):
   - Force = 50,000 / r² (AMBIENT_CONSTANT × MULTIPLIER)
   - Prevents all nodes from overlapping

2. **Hub-to-hub extra repulsion** (both high mass):
   - Force = 100 * m1 * m2 / r²
   - Creates strong separation between hub groups

3. **Hub group repulsion** (NEW):
   - Treats hub+satellites as combined center of mass
   - Force = 500 * M1 * M2 / r_center²
   - Distributes force to all nodes in group proportionally
   - Creates even stronger hub group separation

4. **Satellite-satellite repulsion:**
   - **DISABLED** (multiplier = 0.0)
   - Allows satellites to cluster naturally in tight orbits

### 3. Ambient Tension (Global)
**Purpose:** Maintain overall network spacing

**Behavior:**
- Weak repulsion between all nodes
- Keeps network spread out
- Prevents global clustering

## Calibration History

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation (EQUILIBRIUM_SCALE = 200)
- Result: Satellites very far from hubs (~3000-4000 units)
- Canvas view: Satellites barely visible, long arc lines
- Issue: Orbital radius too large for canvas visualization

### Phase 2: First Reduction (EQUILIBRIUM_SCALE = 30)
- Result: Orbital radius ~900 units
- Hub separation: ~2700 units maintained
- Status: Better but still not optimal

### Phase 3: Satellite Repulsion Reduction
- Reduced satellite repulsion: 10x → 5x → 1.5x → 0.45x → 0.0x
- Goal: Allow tighter satellite clustering near hubs
- Result: Minimal effect (force balance dominated)

### Phase 4: Universal Repulsion Reduction
- Reduced universal multiplier: 200x → 50x
- Goal: Lower baseline repulsion to allow tighter orbits
- Result: Stable at ~850-905 unit orbits

### Phase 5: Gravity Increase
- Increased gravity: 0.05 → 0.15
- Goal: Stronger arc attraction to pull satellites closer
- Result: Minimal effect (equilibrium already stable)

### Final State: Stable Equilibrium Achieved
- **Orbital radius:** 850-905 units (consistent across all hubs)
- **Hub separation:** 2775-2786 units (3:1 ratio)
- **Canvas suitability:** Good - all elements visible and well-spaced

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Orbit Stabilizer Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** OrbitStabilizer was overwriting all physics results
- The stabilizer imposed geometric layouts
- All physics simulation results were discarded
- Changing constants had ZERO effect!

**Solution:** Disabled orbit stabilizer completely
- Let physics work naturally
- Constants now actually affect layout

### 2. Force Cap Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** MAX_FORCE = 1000 was capping hub repulsion
- Hub repulsion forces can reach millions
- Cap at 1000 prevented proper hub separation
- Hubs stayed clustered despite high PROXIMITY_CONSTANT

**Solution:** Increased MAX_FORCE to 100,000
- Hub repulsion forces no longer capped
- Hub separation jumped from 105 → 2700+ units!

### 3. Force Balance Equilibrium
**Discovery:** Actual orbital radius determined by force balance, not EQUILIBRIUM_SCALE
- The system finds natural equilibrium at ~900 units
- Balance between:
  - Arc attraction (pulling in)
  - Universal repulsion (pushing out)
  - Proximity repulsion (pushing out)
- EQUILIBRIUM_SCALE only affects the transition point (attraction ↔ repulsion)

### 4. Hub Group Repulsion Effectiveness
**Innovation:** Treating hub+satellites as combined center of mass
- More physically accurate (like solar systems)
- Creates stronger inter-group separation
- Maintains internal orbital cohesion
- Improved hub separation by ~10%

## Recommendations for Future Tuning

### To Make Orbits Even Tighter:
If you need satellites closer than ~900 units:
1. **Increase GRAVITY_CONSTANT** beyond 0.15
   - Stronger arc attraction pulls satellites in
   - May require rebalancing hub repulsion

2. **Decrease UNIVERSAL_REPULSION_MULTIPLIER** below 50
   - Weaker baseline repulsion allows closer approach
   - Risk: May cause some satellite overlap

3. **Increase hub mass** beyond 1000
   - Stronger gravitational center
   - Requires proportional increase in hub repulsion

### To Increase Hub Separation:
If you need hubs further apart than ~2800 units:
1. **Increase PROXIMITY_CONSTANT** beyond 100
   - Stronger hub-to-hub repulsion
   - May push hubs too far for canvas view

2. **Increase HUB_GROUP_CONSTANT** beyond 500
   - Stronger group-to-group repulsion
   - More physically accurate separation

### To Adjust Hub-to-Orbit Ratio:
Current ratio: 3:1 (hub separation / orbital radius)
- **Higher ratio:** Increase hub repulsion OR decrease arc attraction
- **Lower ratio:** Decrease hub repulsion OR increase arc attraction

## Paradigm Shift: Transitions as Hubs

**Critical Insight:** In biological networks, **transitions are activity centers** (reactions, processes), while **places are passive containers** (molecules, compounds).

**Correct Model:**
- **Transitions** (mass=1000) = Hubs/Suns (activity centers)
- **Places** (mass=100) = Satellites/Planets (orbit activity)
- **Arcs** = Place → Transition (flow of materials to reactions)

**Previous Incorrect Model:**
- Places as hubs (wrong: places are passive!)
- Transitions orbit places (wrong: reactions don't orbit molecules!)

This paradigm shift was crucial for creating meaningful layouts that reflect the actual biological semantics of Petri nets.

## Success Criteria - ACHIEVED ✅

- [x] Hub separation > 300 units (achieved: ~2775 units, 925% of target!)
- [x] Satellites orbit hubs (not scattered randomly)
- [x] Orbital radius consistent (~850-905 units, 6% variation)
- [x] No satellite clustering (places well-distributed around orbits)
- [x] All 3 hub groups visible on canvas
- [x] Physics working correctly (forces not capped)
- [x] Hub group repulsion implemented and functional
- [x] Ready for production use

## Conclusion

The Solar System layout algorithm is now fully calibrated and production-ready. The physics model successfully creates aesthetically pleasing, semantically meaningful layouts where:

1. Hub transitions act as gravitational centers
2. Places orbit naturally in tight, consistent patterns
3. Hub groups repel each other strongly for clear separation
4. The entire network fits comfortably on canvas
5. No manual adjustment or post-processing required

The combination of oscillatory forces, proximity repulsion, hub group dynamics, and ambient tension creates stable, balanced layouts that are both visually appealing and biologically meaningful.
