## üìñ User Guide

### How to Use on Canvas

**Step 1: Toggle Physics Model**
1. Right-click on canvas (background area)
2. Scroll to: **"‚òÄÔ∏è Use Oscillatory Forces (Spring-like)"**
3. **Check** to enable oscillatory forces (spring behavior)
4. **Uncheck** to use hub repulsion (standard)

**Step 2: Apply Layout**
1. Right-click on canvas
2. Select: **"Layout: Solar System (SSCC)"**
3. Watch the layout apply with selected physics model
4. Status message shows: "Physics: [Hub Repulsion / Oscillatory Forces]"

**Step 3: Compare Results**
1. Apply layout with hub repulsion (toggle OFF)
2. Save/screenshot the result
3. Toggle ON oscillatory forces
4. Apply layout again
5. Compare the two layouts!

### What to Look For

**Hub Repulsion (Standard):**
- Hubs spread widely (1300-2900 units apart)
- Strong separation between high-mass nodes
- Explicit repulsion forces prevent clustering
- More "explosive" spreading pattern

**Oscillatory Forces (Spring-like):**
- Hubs naturally spaced (700-1200 units apart)
- Equilibrium distance based on mass + arc weight
- Single oscillatory force (simpler physics)
- More "organic" orbital patterns
- Automatic stable spacing

## üîß Technical Details

### Toggle Implementation

**State Management:**
```python
# In ModelCanvasLoader.__init__()
self._use_oscillatory_forces = False  # Default: hub repulsion
```

**Toggle Handler:**
```python
def _on_toggle_oscillatory_forces(self, menu, drawing_area, manager):
    """Toggle between hub repulsion and oscillatory forces."""
    self._use_oscillatory_forces = not self._use_oscillatory_forces
    mode = "Oscillatory Forces" if self._use_oscillatory_forces else "Hub Repulsion"
    self._show_layout_message(f"Solar System Layout: {mode}", drawing_area)
```

**Engine Creation:**
```python
engine = SolarSystemLayoutEngine(
    iterations=1000,
    use_arc_weight=True,
    scc_radius=50.0,
    planet_orbit=300.0,
    satellite_orbit=50.0,
    use_oscillatory_forces=self._use_oscillatory_forces  # <-- Toggle!
)
```

### Simulator Selection

**In `SolarSystemLayoutEngine.__init__()`:**
```python
# Choose simulator based on physics model
if use_oscillatory_forces:
    from shypn.layout.sscc.oscillatory_gravitational_simulator import OscillatoryGravitationalSimulator
    self.simulator = OscillatoryGravitationalSimulator()
else:
    self.simulator = GravitationalSimulator()
```

**Key Point:** Both simulators share the same base class and interface, so they're **drop-in replacements**!

## üìä Performance Comparison

### Expected Characteristics

**Hub Repulsion:**
- Computation: Standard gravity + Coulomb repulsion (2 force calculations)
- Convergence: May oscillate, needs damping
- Final spacing: Larger distances between hubs
- Use case: Networks with many hubs, need strong separation

**Oscillatory Forces:**
- Computation: Single oscillatory force (1 force calculation)
- Convergence: Natural damping toward equilibrium
- Final spacing: Moderate distances, mass-dependent
- Use case: Networks seeking natural orbital patterns

### Memory & Speed

Both approaches have similar:
- Memory usage: O(V + E) where V=nodes, E=arcs
- Time complexity: O(iterations √ó E)
- Typical runtime: 1-3 seconds for <100 nodes

No significant performance difference expected.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Try It Now!

**1 Minute Test:**

2. Load any Petri net model
3. Right-click canvas ‚Üí Apply "Layout: Solar System (SSCC)"
   (Uses Hub Repulsion by default)

### Recommended First Tests

**Start with:**
- Small cycle (3-5 nodes) - See basic behavior
- Medium network (10-20 nodes) - See scaling
- Real biomodel - See practical application

**Look for:**
- Hub separation (are hubs clustered or spread?)
- Node overlap (any collisions?)
- Arc clarity (can you follow connections?)
- Overall aesthetics (which looks better?)

## üìù Notes

### Default Behavior

**Out of the box:**
- Toggle is **OFF** (Hub Repulsion used)
- This maintains backward compatibility
- Users can opt-in to oscillatory forces

### State Persistence

**Current implementation:**
- Toggle state is per-session (not saved)
- Reset when application restarts
- Could be made persistent in future (save to preferences)

### Future Enhancements

**Possible improvements:**
- Save toggle state in user preferences
- Add parameter sliders for both physics models
- Visual feedback showing equilibrium distances
- Real-time switching (apply layout automatically on toggle)
- Preset profiles: "Compact", "Spread", "Balanced"
