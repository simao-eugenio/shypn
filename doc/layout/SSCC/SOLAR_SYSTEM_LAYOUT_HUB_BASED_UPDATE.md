# Solar System Layout - Hub-Based Mass Assignment Update

## Overview

The Solar System Layout algorithm has been **enhanced** with hub-based mass assignment! This makes high-degree nodes (hubs) become gravitational centers, creating better layouts for networks without cycles or with hub nodes outside SCCs.

## What Changed

### Before (Original)
```python
Mass assignment based ONLY on SCCs:
- SCC nodes: mass = 1000 (stars)
- Places: mass = 100 (planets)
- Transitions: mass = 10 (satellites)
```

**Problem:** Networks without cycles (DAGs) had no gravitational centers, resulting in uniform distribution.

### After (Hub-Based)
```python
Mass assignment based on NODE DEGREE (connectivity):
- Super-hubs (â‰¥6 connections): mass = 1000 (like stars)
- Major hubs (â‰¥4 connections): mass = 500 (strong centers)
- Minor hubs (â‰¥2 connections): mass = 200 (moderate centers)
- Regular places: mass = 100 (normal)
- Regular transitions: mass = 10 (light)

PLUS: SCCs still get mass = 1000 (takes precedence)
```

**Benefit:** Hub nodes become gravitational centers, creating hierarchy even in DAG networks!

## New Parameter

The `SolarSystemLayoutEngine` now accepts a new parameter:

```python
engine = SolarSystemLayoutEngine(
    iterations=1000,
    use_arc_weight=True,
    use_hub_masses=True,    # NEW! (default: True)
    scc_radius=50.0,
    planet_orbit=300.0,
    satellite_orbit=50.0
)
```

**`use_hub_masses` (bool):**
- `True` (default): Use hub-based mass assignment
- `False`: Use original simple SCC-based assignment

## How Hub Detection Works

The algorithm calculates **total degree** for each node:
```
total_degree = in_degree + out_degree
```

**Example:**
- Node with 3 incoming arcs + 2 outgoing arcs = degree 5 â†’ **Major hub** (mass = 500)
- Node with 1 incoming arc + 1 outgoing arc = degree 2 â†’ **Minor hub** (mass = 200)
- Node with 1 incoming arc only = degree 1 â†’ **Regular** (mass = 100 or 10)

**Both places AND transitions** can be hubs!

## Visual Impact on Canvas

### DAG Networks (No Cycles)
**Before:** Uniform distribution, no clear structure  
**After:** Hub nodes cluster at center, others orbit them

### Networks with Cycles + Hubs
**Before:** Only SCC at center  
**After:** SCC at center, hubs with intermediate mass orbit closer, creating multi-layer structure

### Example: BIOMD0000000001
- **Large SCC (15 nodes):** mass = 1000 â†’ Center cluster
- **React3 (5 connections):** mass = 500 â†’ Intermediate orbit
- **React5 (4 connections):** mass = 500 â†’ Intermediate orbit
- **Others:** mass = 100 or 10 â†’ Outer orbits

## Threshold Configuration

Thresholds are defined in `HubBasedMassAssigner`:

```python
SUPER_HUB_THRESHOLD = 6  # â‰¥6 connections
MAJOR_HUB_THRESHOLD = 4  # â‰¥4 connections
MINOR_HUB_THRESHOLD = 2  # â‰¥2 connections
```

**Adjust these** based on network density:
- **Sparse networks:** Lower thresholds (e.g., 4, 3, 2)
- **Dense networks:** Higher thresholds (e.g., 8, 6, 4)

## Statistics

The `get_statistics()` method now includes hub information:

```python
stats = engine.get_statistics()

# Standard stats
print(f"SCCs: {stats['num_sccs']}")
print(f"Avg mass: {stats['avg_mass']}")

# Hub stats (if use_hub_masses=True)
if 'hub_stats' in stats:
    hub_stats = stats['hub_stats']
    print(f"Super-hubs: {len(hub_stats['super_hubs'])}")
    print(f"Major hubs: {len(hub_stats['major_hubs'])}")
    print(f"Minor hubs: {len(hub_stats['minor_hubs'])}")
```

## Testing

**Files:**
1. `tests/test_solar_system_layout_basic.py` - Basic smoke test âœ… PASSING
2. `tests/test_hub_based_layout.py` - Hub-based analysis on SBML files âœ… WORKING

**Test on canvas:**
1. Open Shypn application
2. Load a Petri net (e.g., from `data/biomodels_test/`)
3. Right-click on canvas â†’ "Layout: Solar System (SSCC)"
4. Hub nodes should cluster near center!

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Fully backward compatible!**
- Default behavior: Hub-based masses (better layouts)
- To use original: `use_hub_masses=False`
- All existing code works without changes

## Files Modified

1. `src/shypn/layout/sscc/solar_system_layout_engine.py`
   - Added `use_hub_masses` parameter
   - Integrated `HubBasedMassAssigner`
   - Updated statistics

2. `src/shypn/layout/sscc/hub_based_mass_assigner.py` (NEW)
   - Hub detection logic
   - Mass assignment based on degree
   - Statistics gathering

## Performance

**No performance impact:**
- Hub detection: O(E) where E = number of arcs
- Same complexity as original algorithm
- Negligible overhead

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Update main algorithm
2. âœ… Test on basic smoke test
3. ðŸ”„ Test on canvas with real models
4. ðŸ“‹ Gather user feedback on hub thresholds
5. ðŸŽ¨ Consider UI controls for hub detection settings
