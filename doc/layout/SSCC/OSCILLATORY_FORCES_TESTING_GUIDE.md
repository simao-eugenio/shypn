# Quick Guide: Testing Oscillatory Forces on Canvas

## üéØ How to Test

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**1. Load a Model**
   - Open Shypn
   - Load any Petri net (or create a simple one)
   - Example: Load BIOMD0000000001 from data/biomodels_test/

**2. Apply Standard Layout (Hub Repulsion)**
   ```
   ‚Üí Right-click on canvas background
   ‚Üí Select: "Layout: Solar System (SSCC)"
   ‚Üí Wait for layout to complete
   ‚Üí See message: "Physics: Hub Repulsion"
   ```

**3. Enable Oscillatory Forces**
   ```
   ‚Üí Right-click on canvas background
   ‚Üí Check: "‚òÄÔ∏è Use Oscillatory Forces (Spring-like)"
   ‚Üí See message: "Solar System Layout: Oscillatory Forces"
   ```

**4. Apply Layout Again**
   ```
   ‚Üí Right-click on canvas background
   ‚Üí Select: "Layout: Solar System (SSCC)"
   ‚Üí Wait for layout to complete
   ‚Üí See message: "Physics: Oscillatory Forces"
   ```

**5. Compare Results**
   - Which layout looks better?
   - Are hubs well-separated in both?
   - Any clustering or overlap?
   - Which feels more "natural"?

## üé® Visual Comparison

### Hub Repulsion (Standard) - Toggle OFF

**Characteristics:**
```
Hubs: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà    ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà    ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
      Wide spacing (1300-2900 units)
      Strong repulsion
      "Explosive" pattern
```

**Best for:**
- Many hubs in network
- Need maximum separation
- Proven stable approach

### Oscillatory Forces (Spring-like) - Toggle ON

**Characteristics:**
```
Hubs: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
      Natural spacing (700-1200 units)
      Equilibrium-based
      "Organic" pattern
```

**Best for:**
- Natural orbital appearance
- Mass-dependent spacing
- Experimental/research

## üß™ Suggested Test Models

### 1. Simple Cycle (Quick Test)
**Create manually:**
```
P1 ‚Üí T1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí T2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí T3 ‚Üí P1
```
**Expected:** Small circular layout with both physics models

### 2. Hub Network (Core Test)
**Create manually:**
```
Hub Place (center) with 5-8 connections to transitions
```
**Expected:** Hub at center, satellites around it

### 3. Real Biomodel (Full Test)
**Load from file:**
```
data/biomodels_test/BIOMD0000000001.xml
```
**Expected:**
- Large SCC (cycle of 15 nodes)
- 2 hub nodes outside SCC
- Complex connection patterns

## üìä What to Look For

### Hub Separation
- **Good:** Hubs clearly separated, not clustered
- **Bad:** Hubs overlap or cluster together

### Node Distribution
- **Good:** Balanced spacing, no dense clusters
- **Bad:** Some areas dense, others empty

### Arc Clarity
- **Good:** Can follow arcs easily
- **Bad:** Many crossing arcs, unclear connections

### Overall Aesthetics
- **Good:** Clean, organized, easy to understand
- **Bad:** Chaotic, messy, hard to read

## üí° Tips

### Toggle Behavior
- Toggle state affects **next** layout application
- Check status message to confirm physics model
- Can switch back and forth any time

### Testing Strategy
1. **Start simple:** Test on small network first
2. **Increase complexity:** Try medium networks
3. **Real models:** Test on actual biomodels
4. **Compare:** Take screenshots to compare side-by-side

### Reporting Feedback
If you find issues or preferences:
- Note which network (simple/medium/biomodel)
- Which physics model (hub repulsion / oscillatory)
- What looks good or bad
- Screenshots helpful!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Toggle Not Working?
- Check if checkbox is actually checked/unchecked
- Look at status message after toggling
- Status message should say "Oscillatory Forces" or "Hub Repulsion"

### Layout Looks Same in Both?
- Normal for very small networks (< 5 nodes)
- Difference more visible with:
  - Multiple hubs (3+)
  - Larger networks (10+ nodes)
  - Complex connection patterns

### Nodes Overlap?
- Try applying layout again (may need more iterations)
- Both physics models should prevent overlap
- Report if persistent overlap occurs

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

**Both physics models should:**
- ‚úì Complete without errors
- ‚úì Position all nodes
- ‚úì Prevent hub clustering
- ‚úì Create readable layout
- ‚úì Finish in < 5 seconds

**You should see:**
- ‚úì Clear difference between the two approaches
- ‚úì Hubs well-separated in both
- ‚úì Smooth, stable layouts
- ‚úì No crashes or errors

## üéâ Ready to Test!

**The toggle is working and ready for your feedback!**

Start with a simple network and work your way up to complex biomodels.

**Have fun exploring the two physics approaches!** ‚òÄÔ∏èüåå
