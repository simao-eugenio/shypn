## Testing Protocol

For each test:
1. **YOU DRAW** - Create test case in application
2. **YOU OBSERVE** - What happens?
3. **YOU REPORT** - Tell me:
   - ‚úÖ "Works perfectly"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è "Works but has issue" (describe)
   - ‚ùå "Broken" (describe what's wrong)

## Test Queue

### ‚úÖ Test 3: Arc Transformation (Normal ‚Üí Inhibitor) - PASSED
**Requirement**: Reactive transformation with immediate updates (Req #3, #6)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **PASSED** - Transformation working correctly

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Place ‚Üí Transition: "Convert to Inhibitor Arc" option appears (correct)
- ‚úÖ Transition ‚Üí Place: Option correctly hidden (invalid transformation prevented)
- ‚úÖ Smart validation works as intended
- ‚úÖ User confirmed: "it is intentionally the same option do not appear on arc t -> p"

---

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Weight Text Display - PASSED
**Requirement**: Weight label appears when weight > 1 (Req #7)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **PASSED** - User confirmed: "It's OK"

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Edit Weight dialog works
- ‚úÖ Weight label appears when weight > 1
- ‚úÖ Label positioned correctly at arc midpoint
- ‚úÖ Label is readable

---

### üîÑ Test 5: Interactive Curve Toggle
**Requirement**: Transformation handler for curve/straight toggle (Req #3)

**Instructions**:
1. **Click** on the arc to select it
2. Look for a **transformation handle** (small square) at the arc midpoint
3. **Click the handle once** - arc should toggle to curved
4. **Click the handle again** - arc should return to straight
5. Try **dragging the handle** - should adjust curve amount

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ Handle appears at arc midpoint when arc is selected?
- ‚úÖ Clicking handle toggles straight ‚Üî curved?
- ‚úÖ Dragging handle adjusts curve control point?
- ‚úÖ Curve is smooth and looks good?

**Expected Result**: Interactive curve control via handle

**Status**: ‚è≥ TESTING NOW

**User Report**:
```
(Please select arc, click handle, and report what you see)
```

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Test 2: Context Menu
**Requirement**: Right-click shows context-sensitive menu (Req #2)

**Instructions**:
1. Right-click on the arc you just created

**What to check**:
- Does context menu appear?
- Is there a "Transform Arc ‚ñ∫" submenu?
- Is there an "Edit Weight..." option?
- Are there "Properties" and "Delete" options?

**Expected Result**: Context menu with transformation and editing options

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING (waiting for Test 1)

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Test 3: Arc Transformation (Normal ‚Üí Inhibitor)
**Requirement**: Reactive transformation with immediate updates (Req #3, #6)

**Instructions**:
1. Right-click arc
2. Select "Transform Arc ‚ñ∫ Convert to Inhibitor Arc"

**What to check**:
- Does arc update immediately?
- Does arc change visual style (should show circle at endpoint)?
- Does arc still connect at perimeters?
- Is transformation atomic (no flicker/intermediate states)?

**Expected Result**: Immediate atomic transformation to inhibitor style

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING (waiting for Test 2)

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Test 4: Weight Text Display
**Requirement**: Weight label appears when weight > 1 (Req #7)

**Instructions**:
1. Right-click arc
2. Select "Edit Weight..."
3. Change weight from 1 to 2
4. Click OK

**What to check**:
- Does weight label "2" appear on the arc?
- Is label positioned at arc midpoint?
- Is label readable?

**Expected Result**: Weight label "2" displayed at arc midpoint

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING (waiting for Test 3)

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Test 5: Interactive Curve Toggle
**Requirement**: Transformation handler works (Req #3)

**Instructions**:
1. Select the arc (click on it)
2. Look for transformation handle at arc midpoint
3. Click the handle once

**What to check**:
- Does arc toggle to curved?
- Is curve smooth and visible?
- Click handle again - does it return to straight?

**Expected Result**: Toggle between straight and curved on handle click

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING (waiting for Test 4)

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Test 6: Undo/Redo Transformation
**Requirement**: Atomic transformation is undoable (Req #6)

**Instructions**:
1. Transform arc to inhibitor (if not already)
2. Press Ctrl+Z (Undo)
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Z (Redo)

**What to check**:
- Does undo revert ENTIRE transformation (not partial)?
- Does redo restore transformation completely?
- Is it a single undo step?

**Expected Result**: Transformation is single undoable/redoable operation

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING (waiting for Test 5)

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Test 7: Vertical Arc
**Requirement**: Perimeter intersection works for all directions (Req #1)

**Instructions**:
1. Create Place at (100, 100)
2. Create Transition at (100, 300) - same X, different Y
3. Create arc from Place to Transition

**What to check**:
- Does arc connect at TOP edge of circle?
- Does arc end at BOTTOM edge of rectangle?
- No gaps?

**Expected Result**: Vertical arc connects at perimeters correctly

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Test 8: Diagonal Arc
**Requirement**: Perimeter intersection for arbitrary angles (Req #1)

**Instructions**:
1. Create Place at (100, 100)
2. Create Transition at (300, 300) - diagonal
3. Create arc

**What to check**:
- Arc connects at correct angle on circle edge?
- Arc ends at correct angle on rectangle edge?
- Arrow points in correct direction?

**Expected Result**: Diagonal arc geometry correct

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Test 9: Parallel Arcs
**Requirement**: Multiple arcs between same objects offset correctly

**Instructions**:
1. Create second arc from same Place to same Transition
2. Create third arc in same direction

**What to check**:
- Do arcs offset to avoid overlap?
- Are offsets perpendicular to arc direction?
- Can you click/select individual arcs?

**Expected Result**: Parallel arcs cleanly separated

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Test 10: Bidirectional Arcs
**Requirement**: Arcs in opposite directions work correctly

**Instructions**:
1. Create arc from Transition back to Place (opposite direction)

**What to check**:
- Does reverse arc render correctly?
- Are forward and reverse arcs offset from each other?
- Both connect at perimeters?

**Expected Result**: Bidirectional arcs properly offset

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
