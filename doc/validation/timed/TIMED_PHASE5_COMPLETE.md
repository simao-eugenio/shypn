# Phase 5: Timed Transitions - COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: Implementation Fixed + All Tests Passing ✅  
**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Test Results**: 10/10 passing (100%)

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 successfully completed after identifying and fixing **two critical bugs** in the timed transition implementation. The investigation revealed timing mismatch issues in the controller and a Python truthy/falsy bug in the timing info method.

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Controller Timing Mismatch (Critical)

**Issue**: Timed transitions were checked BEFORE time advanced, causing missed firing opportunities.

**Location**: `src/shypn/engine/simulation/controller.py` - `step()` method

**Root Cause**: Discrete transitions (timed/stochastic) were evaluated at the current time, but the step() method then advanced time, meaning transitions entering their window mid-step were never detected.

**Example**:
```python
# Transition T with window [0.8, 1.2]
# Step from t=0.5 to t=1.0

# BEFORE FIX:
# 1. Check T at t=0.5: elapsed=0.5 < 0.8 → TOO EARLY ❌
# 2. Time advances to t=1.0
# Result: T doesn't fire (but should be in window!)

# AFTER FIX:
# 1. Time advances to t=1.0
# 2. Check T at t=1.0: elapsed=1.0 in [0.8, 1.2] → IN WINDOW ✓
# 3. T fires successfully ✅
```

**Solution**: Moved discrete transition checking to AFTER time advance (Solution Option 1 from investigation).

**Code Change**:
```python
# OLD ORDER (lines 536-556):
discrete_transitions = [...]
enabled_discrete = [t for t in discrete_transitions if self._is_transition_enabled(t)]
# ... handle discrete ...
continuous_active = 0
# ... handle continuous ...
self.time += time_step  # Time advance LAST

# NEW ORDER:
continuous_active = 0
# ... handle continuous ...
self.time += time_step  # Time advance FIRST

# Now check discrete at NEW time
self._update_enablement_states()
discrete_transitions = [...]
enabled_discrete = [t for t in discrete_transitions if self._is_transition_enabled(t)]
# ... handle discrete ...
```

**Impact**: 
- 6 failing tests → 9 passing tests
- Timed transitions now fire correctly when entering window mid-step

---

### Bug #2: Zero Enablement Time Treated as Falsy (Python gotcha)

**Issue**: When a transition was enabled at exactly t=0.0, the timing info reported `elapsed: None` instead of `elapsed: 0.0`.

**Location**: `src/shypn/engine/timed_behavior.py` - `get_timing_info()` method, line 283

**Root Cause**: Python's truthiness evaluation - `if self._enablement_time:` evaluates to `False` when `_enablement_time == 0.0`, even though `0.0` is a valid time.

**Code Change**:
```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
elapsed = current_time - self._enablement_time if self._enablement_time else None
# When _enablement_time=0.0, this returns None (wrong!)

# AFTER (CORRECT):
elapsed = current_time - self._enablement_time if self._enablement_time is not None else None
# When _enablement_time=0.0, this correctly returns current_time - 0.0
```

**Impact**:
- 1 failing test → 1 passing test
- Enablement time tracking now works correctly for transitions enabled at t=0

**Result**: All timed transition behaviors validated ✅

## Validated Behaviors (10 features)

### Timing Windows
1. ✅ **Earliest delay** - Transition waits until `elapsed >= earliest`
2. ✅ **Latest deadline** - Transition fires before `elapsed > latest`
3. ✅ **Window firing** - Transition fires when `earliest <= elapsed <= latest`
4. ✅ **Zero earliest** - Transition can fire immediately when `earliest=0`
5. ✅ **Infinite latest** - No upper bound when `latest=inf`

### Enablement Tracking
6. ✅ **Enablement time recording** - Time when transition becomes enabled is tracked
7. ✅ **Elapsed time calculation** - Correct elapsed time from enablement (Bug #2 fixed)
8. ✅ **Timing properties** - earliest/latest correctly configured

### Structural Constraints
9. ✅ **Multiple firings** - Timed transition can fire multiple times
10. ✅ **Token requirements** - Insufficient tokens prevent firing (structural > timing)

## Coverage Analysis

### Before Fix (Phase 5 Start)
- **timed_behavior.py**: 9% coverage
- **Reason**: Most code paths unreachable due to Bug #1

### After Fix (Phase 5 Complete)
- **timed_behavior.py**: 68% coverage (+59%)
- **Overall engine/**: 37% (+6% from 31%)

**Significant Improvement**: Fixing Bug #1 made the timed behavior code actually execute, dramatically increasing coverage.

## Investigation Summary

### Timeline
1. **Initial Tests**: 4/10 passing (40%) - major issue detected
2. **Investigation**: Created TIMED_PHASE5_INVESTIGATION.md with root cause analysis
3. **Proposed Solutions**: 3 options identified (post-step check, window intersection, event queue)
4. **Implementation**: Solution Option 1 (simplest) - moved time advance before discrete check
5. **Secondary Bug**: Discovered Python truthiness issue with 0.0 enablement time
6. **Final Result**: 10/10 passing (100%) ✅

### Why Bug #1 Was Missed Initially
The controller's step() method had the correct structure for immediate transitions (exhausted in a loop), but the discrete transition check happened at the wrong time. This is a subtle timing issue that only becomes apparent when:
- Transition enters window mid-step (not at step boundary)
- Window doesn't span entire step duration

   - Lines 529-557 refactored

2. **`/src/shypn/engine/timed_behavior.py`** (Bug #2)
   - Fixed truthiness check: `if self._enablement_time:` → `if self._enablement_time is not None:`
   - Line 283

### Test Files

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Order Matters**: In discrete-event simulation, the order of operations (check enablement vs advance time) is critical
2. **Python Truthiness**: Always use `is not None` for numeric values that can be zero
3. **Mid-Step Events**: Transitions entering windows between step boundaries require special handling

### Testing Insights
1. **Edge Cases Are Critical**: Testing with t=0.0 enablement revealed Bug #2
2. **Multiple Step Sizes**: Testing with different step durations exposed Bug #1
3. **Window Variations**: Testing zero-width, normal, and infinite windows ensures completeness
