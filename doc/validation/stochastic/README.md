# Stochastic Transition Validation

**Transition Type:** Stochastic  
**Status:** Not Yet Planned  
**Priority:** Phase 3

---

## Overview

This directory will contain validation documentation and test plans for **stochastic transitions** in SHYpn Petri nets.

**Stochastic transitions** fire with exponentially distributed delays (memoryless property).

---

## Coming Soon

- Benchmark plan with test categories
- Properties specific to stochastic transitions
- Exponential distribution validation
- Statistical testing methodology

---

## Stochastic Transition Characteristics

**Key Properties:**
- `transition_type` = 'stochastic'
- `rate` - Rate parameter (Î») for exponential distribution
- `guard` - Enable condition
- `priority` - Conflict resolution (with immediate transitions)

**Behavior:**
- Firing time ~ Exponential(Î»)
- Memoryless property (Markovian)
- Multiple stochastic transitions compete via race condition

---

## Status

ðŸ”œ **Planning not yet started**

Will be addressed after immediate and timed transition validation.
