## 🧪 Test Details

### Test 1: test_fires_when_enabled ✅
**Purpose**: Verify enabled transition fires  
**Setup**: P1 has 1 token  
**Action**: Run simulation  
**Verification**: 
- P1 has 0 tokens (consumed)
- P2 has 1 token (produced)
- 1 firing event occurred

**Result**: PASSED

---

### Test 2: test_does_not_fire_when_disabled ✅
**Purpose**: Verify disabled transition doesn't fire  
**Setup**: P1 has 0 tokens (transition disabled)  
**Action**: Run simulation  
**Verification**:
- P1 has 0 tokens (unchanged)
- P2 has 0 tokens (unchanged)
- 0 firing events

**Result**: PASSED

---

### Test 3: test_fires_immediately_at_t0 ✅
**Purpose**: Verify immediate firing in first step  
**Setup**: P1 has 1 token  
**Action**: Run simulation  
**Verification**:
- At least 1 firing occurred
- First firing at t ≤ 0.001
- Token moved to P2

**Result**: PASSED

**Note**: Immediate transitions fire in "zero time" but recorded after time step (t=0.001)

---

### Test 4: test_fires_multiple_times ✅
**Purpose**: Verify immediate transitions exhaust tokens  
**Setup**: P1 has 3 tokens  
**Action**: Run simulation  
**Verification**:
- P1 has 0 tokens (all consumed)
- P2 has 3 tokens (all produced)

**Result**: PASSED

**Note**: All 3 firings happen in one step() call (immediate exhaustion)

---

### Test 5: test_consumes_tokens_correctly ✅
**Purpose**: Verify correct token consumption  
**Setup**: P1 has 5 tokens, arc weight=1  
**Action**: Run simulation  
**Verification**:
- P1 has 0 tokens (5 consumed)
- Each firing consumes exactly 1 token

**Result**: PASSED

---

### Test 6: test_produces_tokens_correctly ✅
**Purpose**: Verify correct token production  
**Setup**: P1 has 5 tokens, arc weight=1  
**Action**: Run simulation  
**Verification**:
- P2 has 5 tokens (5 produced)
- Each firing produces exactly 1 token

**Result**: PASSED

## 🐛 Issues & Warnings

### Warning 1: GTK Import (Non-Critical)
```
PyGIWarning: Gtk was imported without specifying a version first.
```

**Impact**: None (tests run successfully)  
**Fix**: Add `gi.require_version('Gtk', '4.0')` before import  
**Priority**: Low (cosmetic only)

### Issue: Low Coverage (21%)
**Impact**: Many code paths untested  
**Fix**: Expand test suite with arc weights, guards, priorities  
**Priority**: Medium (planned expansion)

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Execution Time** | 80ms | ✅ Excellent |
| **Per-Test Average** | 13ms | ✅ Fast |
| **Coverage Collection Overhead** | +420ms | ⚠️ Noticeable |
| **Memory Usage** | <50MB | ✅ Low |

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Immediate Transition Behavior
- All immediate transitions exhaust in one `step()` call
- Firing is recorded after time advancement (t=0.001)
- Test state changes, not event counts

### 2. Fixture Design
- `ptp_model` fixture is reusable and efficient
- `run_simulation` fixture handles step-based execution
- Custom assertions make tests readable

### 3. Coverage Insights
- 21% coverage is good baseline for basic tests
- Need targeted tests for specific features
- Arc and transition logic need more coverage
