# Parallel Arc Double-Click Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Issue**: Second parallel arc (opposite direction) doesn't respond to double-click

## Root Cause

Found legacy code in `model_canvas_loader.py` (lines 991-998) that **blocked double-click edit mode** for parallel arcs:

```python
# OLD CODE (REMOVED):
if is_parallel_arc:
    # Just select the arc, don't enter edit mode
    if not clicked_obj.selected:
        manager.selection_manager.toggle_selection(clicked_obj, multi=is_ctrl, manager=manager)
    return True  # Blocked edit mode!
```

This was probably added for the old automatic parallel arc system to prevent conflicts. With manual curve control, this block is no longer needed.

## Fix Applied

**File**: `src/shypn/helpers/model_canvas_loader.py`  
**Lines**: 983-1007  
**Action**: Removed parallel arc double-click blocking code

**New code** (simplified):
```python
if is_double_click:
    # Double-click behavior: enter edit mode
    # Users now have full manual control over curved arc transformations
    
    if clicked_obj.selected:
        manager.selection_manager.enter_edit_mode(clicked_obj, manager=manager)
    else:
        manager.selection_manager.toggle_selection(clicked_obj, multi=is_ctrl, manager=manager)
        manager.selection_manager.enter_edit_mode(clicked_obj, manager=manager)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ All arcs respond to double-click
- First arc A→B: Double-click works ✓
- Second arc B→A: Double-click works ✓
- Third arc A→B: Double-click works ✓

### ✅ Overlapping straight arcs is CORRECT
Both arcs start and end at the **same boundary points** when straight:
```
Place ●─────────────────● Transition
       ↑
    Both arcs here (overlapping)
```

This is **intentional** because:
1. Both arcs connect same two nodes
2. Both use actual boundary points (not offset)
3. Visual separation happens when arcs are **curved**

### ✅ Curved arcs separate visually

After curving each arc in opposite directions:
```
Place ●──╱───────────────╲──● Transition
      ╲──────────────────╱
      ↑                  ↑
   Curved up         Curved down
   (Arc A→B)         (Arc B→A)
```

The **endpoints remain the same**, but the **curves go different directions**.

## Testing

1. **Draw arc A→B** (straight) ✓
2. **Double-click A→B** → Edit mode activates ✓
3. **Drag handle** → Arc curves ✓
4. **Click away** → Exit edit mode ✓
5. **Draw arc B→A** (straight, overlaps first) ✓
6. **Double-click B→A** → Edit mode activates ✓ (FIXED!)
7. **Drag handle opposite direction** → Arc curves opposite way ✓
8. **Result**: Two arcs with same endpoints but different curves ✓

## Parallel Arc Offset Behavior

### For Straight Arcs (is_curved = False)
- **Parallel offset detected**: Yes (e.g., ±50px)
- **Parallel offset applied**: No (because straight)
- **Result**: Arcs overlap completely
- **Reason**: Straight arcs don't have a control point to offset

### For Curved Arcs (is_curved = True)
- **Parallel offset detected**: Yes (e.g., ±50px)
- **Parallel offset applied**: Yes (to control point)
- **Result**: Arcs curve in different directions
- **Calculation**:
  ```python
  mid_x = (start_x + end_x) / 2
  mid_y = (start_y + end_y) / 2
  
  # Apply perpendicular offset
  if parallel_offset != 0:
      mid_x += perp_x * parallel_offset
      mid_y += perp_y * parallel_offset
  
  control_x = mid_x + user_control_offset_x
  control_y = mid_y + user_control_offset_y
  ```

## Debug Output

Added temporary debug to verify parallel offset detection:
```python
if abs(parallel_offset) > 1e-6:
    print(f"Arc {self.id}: detected parallel offset = {parallel_offset:.1f}px, is_curved={self.is_curved}")
```

**Expected output when drawing two arcs**:
- First arc (A→B, straight): No output (no parallels yet)
- Second arc (B→A, straight): `Arc 2: detected parallel offset = 50.0px, is_curved=False`
- After curving first arc: `Arc 1: detected parallel offset = -50.0px, is_curved=True`
- After curving second arc: `Arc 2: detected parallel offset = 50.0px, is_curved=True`

## Visual Expectation

### Scenario: Two straight parallel arcs
```
●─────────────────●
Both arcs here (can't see second one - it's behind)
```
**This is correct!** Both arcs use same boundary points.

### Scenario: Two curved parallel arcs
```
●──╱──────────╲──●
   ╲────────╱
   First    Second
   (up)     (down)
```
**Endpoints still at same positions!** Only curves are different.

### Key Point: Endpoints DON'T Move

The parallel arc offset affects **control point** only:
- ✅ Same start point (boundary of source)
- ✅ Same end point (boundary of target)  
- ✅ Different middle (control point offset)

This creates visual separation while maintaining correct boundary anchoring.

## Summary

**Issue 2 FIXED**: ✅ Removed double-click blocking for parallel arcs  
**Issue 3 CLARIFIED**: ✅ Same start/end points is **correct behavior**

The arcs are working as designed:
- Straight arcs overlap (expected)
- Curved arcs separate via control point offset (expected)
- All arcs anchor at actual boundaries (correct)
- Double-click works on all arcs (fixed!)
