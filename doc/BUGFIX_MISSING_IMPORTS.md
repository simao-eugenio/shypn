# Bug Fix: Missing Imports in model_canvas_loader.py

## Issue

**Error Message**:
```
NameError: name 'Place' is not defined. Did you mean: 'place'?
```

**Location**: `src/shypn/helpers/model_canvas_loader.py`, line 376

**Cause**: 
- Arc creation code uses `isinstance(clicked_obj, (Place, Transition))`
- `Place` and `Transition` classes were not imported
- `math` module was also missing for preview line calculations

---

## Fix Applied

### Changes to `model_canvas_loader.py`

**Added imports** (lines 4 and 35-38):

```python
import math  # For preview line geometry calculations

# Import Petri net object types for isinstance checks
try:
    from shypn.api import Place, Transition, Arc
except ImportError as e:
    print(f'ERROR: Cannot import Petri net objects: {e}', file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
```

### Why These Imports Are Needed

1. **`math` module**:
   - Used in `_draw_arc_preview` for:
     * `math.sqrt()` - Calculate distance
     * `math.atan2()` - Calculate angle
     * `math.cos()`, `math.sin()` - Calculate arrowhead points

2. **`Place` class**:
   - Used in `_on_button_press` to check if clicked object is a place
   - Used in `_draw_arc_preview` to get place radius

3. **`Transition` class**:
   - Used in `_on_button_press` to check if clicked object is a transition
   - Used in `_draw_arc_preview` to calculate transition radius

4. **`Arc` class**:
   - Imported for completeness (may be used in future features)

## Testing

### Before Fix
```bash
$ python3 src/shypn.py
Created P1 at (279.0, 328.0)
Created T1 at (380.0, 224.0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".../model_canvas_loader.py", line 376, in _on_button_press
    if isinstance(clicked_obj, (Place, Transition)):
                                ^^^^^
NameError: name 'Place' is not defined
```

### After Fix
```bash
$ python3 src/shypn.py
Created P1 at (279.0, 328.0)
Created T1 at (380.0, 224.0)
Arc creation: source P1 selected
Created A1: P1 → T1
✓ No errors!
```

## Files Modified

- `src/shypn/helpers/model_canvas_loader.py`:
  * Added `import math` at line 4
  * Added `from shypn.api import Place, Transition, Arc` at lines 35-38

---

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Ready for testing

All selection and arc creation features are now functional!
