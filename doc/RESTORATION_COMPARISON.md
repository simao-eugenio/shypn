# Restoration Comparison: What We Have vs What Was Lost

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Last Stable Commit**: c9632cc "Add DragController for object drag-and-drop"  
**Status**: ✅ RESTORED AND ENHANCED

---

## Overview

After the UI crash caused by incomplete canvas adapter implementation, we rolled back to commit c9632cc and selectively restored/reimplemented working components. This document compares what we have now versus what was lost.

---

## 🎯 What We Successfully Restored

### 1. ✅ Transition Engine (FULLY RESTORED + WORKING)

**Status**: Complete and functional, no UI interference

**Files Restored** (7 files, ~61KB):
```
src/shypn/engine/
  ├── __init__.py (299 lines)
  ├── transition_behavior.py (216 lines)
  ├── immediate_transition.py (169 lines)
  ├── timed_transition.py (231 lines)
  ├── stochastic_transition.py (264 lines)
  └── probabilistic_transition.py (239 lines)
```

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ 4 transition types implemented
  - **Immediate** - Zero delay, fires instantly
  - **Timed** - Fixed delay (deterministic)
  - **Stochastic** - Exponential distribution (random delay)
  - **Probabilistic** - Multiple outcomes with probabilities
- ✅ All 4 behaviors tested and working
- ✅ Zero UI dependencies (pure logic)
- ✅ Ready for simulation integration

**Documentation Added**:
- `TRANSITION_ENGINE_COMPLETE_INDEX.md` - Main index
- `TRANSITION_ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Full specification
- `TRANSITION_ENGINE_QUICK_START.md` - Usage guide
- `TRANSITION_ENGINE_SUMMARY.md` - Technical summary
- `TRANSITION_ENGINE_VISUAL.md` - Visual examples
- `TRANSITION_TYPES_QUICK_REF.md` - Quick reference

**Verification**: ✓ Successfully imported, all 4 behaviors accessible

### 2. ✅ Drag Functionality (FULLY IMPLEMENTED + FIXED)

**Status**: Complete and working correctly

**Files Modified/Created**:
```
MODIFIED:
  - src/shypn/edit/drag_controller.py (+30 lines debug/defensive)
  - src/shypn/edit/selection_manager.py (+85 lines drag methods)
  - src/shypn/helpers/model_canvas_loader.py (+25 lines integration)

CREATED:
  - tests/test_drag_integration.py (192 lines)
```

**Implementation**:
- ✅ DragController (existed in c9632cc, now integrated)
- ✅ SelectionManager drag coordination (NEW)
- ✅ Loader event routing (NEW)
- ✅ ESC key cancel support (NEW)

**Features Working**:
- ✅ Single object drag
- ✅ Multi-object drag (Ctrl+click)
- ✅ Rectangle selection → drag
- ✅ Drag cancel with ESC (restores positions)
- ✅ Arcs follow automatically when nodes move
- ✅ Selection preserved during drag

**Bugs Fixed** (3 major fixes):
1. **Group Selection Drag Error** (KeyError)
   - Fixed motion handler priority order
   - Rectangle selection now has priority
   
2. **Selection Dismissed When Dragging**
   - Cancel pending single-click when drag starts
   - Preserves multi-selection during drag
   
3. **Drag Fails With Arcs in Selection**
   - Filter out arcs from draggable objects
   - Arcs follow source/target automatically

**Documentation Added**:
- `DRAG_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - Main documentation
- `DRAG_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture design
- `DRAG_FIX_GROUP_SELECTION.md` - Fix #1 details
- `DRAG_FIX_SELECTION_DISMISS.md` - Fix #2 details
- `DRAG_FIX_ARC_IN_SELECTION.md` - Fix #3 details
- `DRAG_SYSTEM_STATUS.md` - System overview

**Verification**: ✓ Tested with GTK UI, all scenarios working

## ❌ What Was Lost (And Why)

### 1. ❌ Canvas Adapter Implementation (REMOVED - INCOMPLETE)

**What it was**: Bridge between ModelCanvasManager and new DocumentCanvas

**Why removed**: 
- Incomplete implementation (~29KB, 610 lines)
- Missing critical rendering methods:
  - `draw_grid()` - Grid not visible
  - `get_visible_bounds()` - Pan/zoom broken
  - `get_zoom_percentage()` - Zoom display broken
  - `create_new_document()` - Document lifecycle broken
- Caused UI instability and panel crashes
- Each fix revealed more missing methods (cascade of issues)

**Files Removed**:
```
DELETED:
  - src/shypn/data/canvas_adapter.py (~610 lines)
  - tests/test_canvas_integration.py (13 tests)
  - src/shypn/edit/editing_controller.py (wrapper, redundant)
  - doc/CANVAS_*.md (4 files, adapter-related)
```

**Impact**: None - adapter was not functional, removal fixed UI

**Alternative**: Current architecture works without adapter:
```
BEFORE (broken):
ModelCanvasLoader → CanvasAdapter → DocumentCanvas
                    (incomplete)

AFTER (working):
ModelCanvasLoader → ModelCanvasManager
                    (stable, tested)
```

---

### 2. ❌ Canvas Architecture Refactoring (POSTPONED)

**What it was**: New canvas architecture with DocumentCanvas

**Status**: Exists but not integrated, no UI changes

**Files Exist** (not modified):
```
src/shypn/data/canvas/
  ├── document_canvas.py (working, complete)
  ├── document_model.py (working, complete)
  └── canvas_state.py (restored from git)
```

**Why postponed**:
- Requires complete adapter implementation (~60+ methods)
- High risk of UI instability
- Current architecture is stable and sufficient
- Can be integrated later when fully tested

**Decision**: Keep files but don't integrate until:
1. Complete adapter with ALL methods
2. Comprehensive test suite
3. Gradual integration path
4. Fallback mechanism
