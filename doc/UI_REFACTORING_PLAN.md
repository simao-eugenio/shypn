# UI Refactoring Plan - Wayland Compatibility

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Backup:** `legacy/wayland_fixes_complete_20251021_152238.tar.gz` (6.4MB)  
**Objective:** Fix Wayland Error 71 while preserving ALL topology integration and business logic

---

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What Works (MUST PRESERVE)
1. **Topology Panel Integration** - Complete with 3 tabs, nested expanders, all analysis features
2. **FileChooser Async Pattern** - All dialogs work perfectly with async signal-based approach
3. **Business Logic** - All controllers, data collectors, analysis engines work correctly
4. **Isolation Tests** - All panels work perfectly when isolated (NO Error 71)
5. **Model Canvas** - All drawing, editing, simulation features work
6. **SBML Import** - Async threaded import works perfectly
7. **Panel Functionality** - File explorer, analyses, pathways, topology all functional

### ‚ùå What Breaks (NEEDS FIXING)
1. **Widget Reparenting** - `container.add(widget)` after `window.show_all()` causes Wayland Error 71
2. **Master Palette Coded UI** - Complex toggle logic was adding unnecessary complexity
3. **Panel Architecture** - Separate window files + dynamic reparenting incompatible with Wayland

### üîç Root Cause
**Wayland protocol doesn't support widget reparenting after window realization.**
When we call `window.show_all()`, all widgets become "realized" (allocated Wayland surfaces).
Calling `container.add(widget)` after this tries to reparent an already-realized widget,
which Wayland interprets as a protocol violation ‚Üí Error 71.

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Revert to Last Working State ‚úÖ DONE
- [x] Created complete backup: `legacy/wayland_fixes_complete_20251021_152238.tar.gz`
- [x] Backup includes: src/, ui/, doc/, tests/, dev/, all root files
- [x] Backup excludes: .git, __pycache__, htmlcov, workspace (user data)

### Phase 2: Simplify Master Palette (Keep Recent Fix)
**Keep:** Simple callback connections (no complex exclusive logic in MasterPalette class)  
**Revert:** The experimental main_builder integration that broke loading

**Files to modify:**
- `src/shypn/ui/master_palette.py` - Keep simplified connect() method
- `src/shypn.py` - Keep toggle handlers with explicit button deactivation

**Why:** The simplified Master Palette is actually better - moves exclusive logic to
handlers where it's more explicit and easier to debug.

### Phase 3: Fix Panel Architecture (The Critical Part)

#### Option A: Accept Error 71 as Benign (RECOMMENDED)
**Approach:** One Error 71 at startup is acceptable if app works perfectly after
- Keep current panel loader architecture
- Document that Error 71 is expected and harmless
- All functionality works correctly despite the error
- Zero user impact

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Preserves ALL existing code
- ‚úÖ Minimal changes needed
- ‚úÖ Topology integration untouched
- ‚úÖ Quick implementation (< 1 hour)

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå One console error message at startup
- ‚ùå Not "clean" solution

#### Option B: Pure Visibility Toggle (NO REPARENTING)
**Approach:** Panel content lives permanently in main_window.ui, just toggle visibility

**Changes needed:**
1. Define all 4 panel content areas in `ui/main/main_window.ui`:
   ```xml
   <object class="GtkStack" id="left_dock_stack">
     <child>
       <object class="GtkBox" id="files_panel_content">
         <!-- Content loaded from left_panel.ui at startup -->
       </object>
     </child>
     <child>
       <object class="GtkBox" id="analyses_panel_content">
         <!-- Content loaded from right_panel.ui at startup -->
       </object>
     </child>
     <!-- etc for pathways and topology -->
   </object>
   ```

2. Panel loaders populate containers BEFORE `window.show_all()`
3. Toggle handlers just call `stack.set_visible_child()`
4. NO add/remove operations after window is shown

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Completely eliminates Error 71
- ‚úÖ "Clean" architecture
- ‚úÖ Better performance (no reparenting overhead)

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå Significant refactoring (8-16 hours)
- ‚ùå Risk of breaking topology integration
- ‚ùå All 4 panel loaders need changes
- ‚ùå Testing required for each panel

#### Option C: Force X11 Mode
**Approach:** Add `os.environ["GDK_BACKEND"] = "x11"` at startup

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Zero code changes
- ‚úÖ Completely eliminates Error 71
- ‚úÖ Works immediately

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå Doesn't use native Wayland
- ‚ùå Loses Wayland benefits (better scaling, security)
- ‚ùå Not a real fix, just avoidance

## Recommended Plan (Hybrid Approach)

### Step 1: Revert Broken Changes (30 minutes)
1. Revert `left_panel_loader.py` to version before main_builder integration
2. Revert `main_window.ui` to remove the 4 placeholder containers
3. Keep simplified `master_palette.py` (it's actually better)
4. Keep all async FileChooser fixes
5. Keep all topology integration untouched

### Step 2: Test and Verify (15 minutes)
1. Run app and verify it works
2. Confirm ONE Error 71 at startup (acceptable)
3. Verify ALL panels work (Files, Analyses, Pathways, Topology)
4. Verify ALL buttons work in each panel
5. Verify float/attach works
6. Verify topology panel has all 3 tabs and all features

### Step 3: Document Current State (15 minutes)
1. Add comment in shypn.py explaining Error 71 is expected
2. Update README with known issue section
3. Document that Error 71 is benign and app works perfectly
4. Reference isolation tests showing panels work correctly

### Step 4: Future Consideration (Optional, Later)
If Error 71 becomes problematic (it shouldn't), implement Option B:
- Plan detailed refactoring schedule
- Test each panel loader modification separately
- Use GtkStack for panel switching
- Eliminate all widget reparenting

## Next Steps

**Immediate Action:** Revert to last working state, keep improvements, accept Error 71 as benign.

**Command to restore from backup if needed:**
```bash
cd /home/simao/projetos/shypn
tar -xzf legacy/wayland_fixes_complete_20251021_152238.tar.gz -C /tmp/shypn_restore
# Then selectively copy files that need restoration
```

**Testing Command:**
```bash
cd /home/simao/projetos/shypn
python3 src/shypn.py 2>&1 | tee test_output.log
# Check for: one Error 71, then app works normally
```
