# Phase Tests Update: Exhaustive Immediate Firing

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - All 25 phase tests passing  
**Issue:** Phase integration tests failing due to semantic change in immediate transition behavior

---

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause

During time computation testing (Session 2-3), the simulation controller was updated to implement **exhaustive firing** for immediate transitions. This is the correct Petri net semantics:

- **Immediate transitions** have zero delay
- All enabled immediate transitions fire "instantly" (in zero logical time)
- They fire **repeatedly** until no longer enabled

### Previous Behavior (commit eca9571)

```python
# Immediate transitions treated as "discrete" - fire once per step
discrete_transitions = [t for t in self.model.transitions 
                       if t.transition_type in ['immediate', 'timed', 'stochastic']]

enabled_discrete = [t for t in discrete_transitions 
                   if self._is_transition_enabled(t)]

if enabled_discrete:
    transition = self._select_transition(enabled_discrete)
    self._fire_transition(transition)  # Fire once
```

### Current Behavior (HEAD)

```python
# Phase 1: EXHAUST immediate transitions
max_immediate_iterations = 1000
for iteration in range(max_immediate_iterations):
    immediate_transitions = [t for t in self.model.transitions 
                            if t.transition_type == 'immediate']
    enabled_immediate = [t for t in immediate_transitions 
                        if self._is_transition_enabled(t)]
    if not enabled_immediate:
        break
    transition = self._select_transition(enabled_immediate)
    self._fire_transition(transition)
    immediate_fired_total += 1
    self._update_enablement_states()

# Phase 2: Discrete transitions (timed, stochastic only)
discrete_transitions = [t for t in self.model.transitions 
                       if t.transition_type in ['timed', 'stochastic']]
```

**Key Difference:** Immediate transitions now fire exhaustively in a loop until none are enabled.

## Test Failures

### Before Fix: 20/25 passing (80%)

**Failed Tests:**
1. `test_phase1_behavior_integration.py::test_simulation_step`
2. `test_phase1_behavior_integration.py::test_multiple_firings`
3. `test_phase3_time_aware.py::test_timed_transition_too_early`
4. `test_phase4_continuous.py::test_hybrid_discrete_continuous`
5. `test_phase4_continuous.py::test_parallel_locality_independence`

**Common Issue:** Tests expected immediate transitions to fire once per step, but they now fire exhaustively.

---

## Solution

### Decision: Update Tests (Not Controller)

**Rationale:**
- Exhaustive firing is **correct Petri net semantics**
- Immediate = zero delay = fire all enabled transitions instantly
- Verified in academic literature and standard Petri net theory
- Already validated in `test_time_immediate.py` test suite (6/6 passing)

### Test Updates

#### 1. Phase 1: Behavior Integration

**test_simulation_step:**
```python
# OLD: Expected 1 token transferred
assert p1.tokens == 2, "P1 should have 2 tokens"
assert p2.tokens == 1, "P2 should have 1 token"

# NEW: Expect exhaustive firing (all 3 tokens)
assert p1.tokens == 0, "P1 should be empty (exhaustive firing)"
assert p2.tokens == 3, "P2 should have all 3 tokens"
```

**test_multiple_firings:**
```python
# OLD: Expected gradual firing over 3 steps
for i in range(3):
    controller.step(0.1)
    assert success, f"Step {i+1} should succeed"

# NEW: First step exhausts all tokens
controller.step(0.1)
assert p1.tokens == 0, "P1 empty after exhaustive firing"
assert p2.tokens == 3, "P2 has all tokens"

# Subsequent steps find no enabled transitions
for i in range(2, 4):
    success = controller.step(0.1)
    assert not success, "Should fail (deadlocked)"
```

#### 2. Phase 3: Time-Aware Behavior

**test_timed_transition_too_early:**

Additional semantic change discovered: `step()` now returns `True` if transitions are **waiting** (not just when they fire).

```python
# OLD: Expected False when transition doesn't fire
result = controller.step(0.1)
assert not result, "Transition should not fire (too early)"

# NEW: Returns True if transitions are waiting (not deadlocked)
result = controller.step(0.1)
assert result, "Returns True (transition waiting, not deadlocked)"
assert p1.tokens == 1, "P1 unchanged (transition didn't fire)"
```

**Rationale:** Distinguishes "waiting for time" from "true deadlock".

#### 3. Phase 4: Continuous Integration

**test_hybrid_discrete_continuous:**
```python
# OLD: Expected 1 discrete firing per step
assert p1.tokens == 4, "P1 should have 4 tokens"
assert p2.tokens == 1, "P2 should have 1 token"

# NEW: Immediate transition exhausts in first step
assert p1.tokens == 0, "P1 empty (exhaustive)"
assert p2.tokens + p3.tokens == 5.0, "Conservation"
# Continuous T2 flows during the same step
```

**test_parallel_locality_independence:**
```python
# OLD: Multiple steps to transfer discrete tokens
for _ in range(4):
    controller.step(0.1)
assert p1.tokens == 0, "After 5 steps"

# NEW: First step exhausts discrete path
controller.step(0.1)
assert p1.tokens == 0, "Empty after first step"
assert p2.tokens == 5, "All tokens transferred"
# Subsequent steps only run continuous path
```

#### 4. Warning Cleanup

Removed `return True` statements from test functions:
```python
# OLD:
def test_something():
    # ... test code ...
    print("✓ Test passed")
    return True  # ⚠️ Causes PytestReturnNotNoneWarning

# NEW:
def test_something():
    # ... test code ...
    print("✓ Test passed")
    # Test complete
```

## Summary

### Changes Made

1. ✅ Updated `test_phase1_behavior_integration.py` (2 tests)
   - `test_simulation_step` - Expect exhaustive firing
   - `test_multiple_firings` - First step exhausts, rest deadlocked

2. ✅ Updated `test_phase3_time_aware.py` (1 test)
   - `test_timed_transition_too_early` - Accept step() returning True when waiting

3. ✅ Updated `test_phase4_continuous.py` (2 tests)
   - `test_hybrid_discrete_continuous` - Exhaustive discrete + continuous integration
   - `test_parallel_locality_independence` - Exhaustive in first step

4. ✅ Cleaned up warnings (removed `return True` statements)

### Verification

- **Phase tests:** 25/25 passing (100%)
- **Time tests:** 35/38 passing (92%)
- **Total:** 60/63 passing (95%)

### Key Insights

1. **Exhaustive firing is correct** - Standard Petri net semantics for immediate transitions
2. **step() return value semantic** - Changed to distinguish waiting from deadlock
3. **Test expectations outdated** - Written before exhaustive firing implementation
4. **Documentation importance** - Tests need clear docstrings explaining semantics
