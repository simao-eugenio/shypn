# File Panel Project Opening Feature

## Overview

Implemented a dialog-free project opening feature in the File Panel. Users can now open projects directly by selecting them in the file tree, avoiding the need for dialogs.

## User Experience

### Method 1: Double-click on Project File
- User navigates to a `.shy` project file in the file tree
- Double-click on the `.shy` file → project opens immediately

### Method 2: Double-click on Project Folder
- User double-clicks on a folder containing a `.shy` file
- System automatically finds the `.shy` file and opens the project

### Method 3: "Open Project" Button Mode
- User clicks "Open Project" button in Project Actions category
- File Panel enters "Project Opening Mode"
- Path entry shows: "SELECT PROJECT TO OPEN..."
- Next click on any project folder or `.shy` file opens that project
- Mode exits automatically after selection

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/shypn/ui/file_panel_controller.py`

**Added State Management:**
```python
self.project_opening_mode = False  # Flag for "Open Project" mode
self.on_project_opened = None  # Callback when project is opened
```

**Enhanced Row Activation (`on_row_activated`):**
- Detects `.shy` files and opens them as projects
- Detects project folders (containing `.shy` files) and opens the project
- Falls back to normal navigation for non-project folders

**Enhanced Selection Handler (`on_selection_changed`):**
- When in `project_opening_mode`, automatically opens selected projects
- Works with both files and folders

**New Methods:**
- `_find_project_file_in_folder(folder_path)`: Searches folder for `.shy` files
- `_open_project(project_path)`: Opens a project and triggers callback
- `on_open_project(button)`: Enters project opening mode

#### 2. `src/shypn/helpers/project_actions_controller.py`

**Added File Panel Integration:**
```python
self.file_panel_controller = None  # Reference to file panel controller
```

**Updated Open Project Handler:**
```python
def _on_open_project_clicked(self, button):
    if self.file_panel_controller:
        # Use new tree-based selection mode
        self.file_panel_controller.on_open_project(button)
    else:
        # Fallback to dialog for compatibility
        self.dialog_manager.show_open_project_dialog()
```

**New Setter Method:**
```python
def set_file_panel_controller(self, file_panel_controller):
    """Wire file panel for project opening mode."""
```

#### 3. `src/shypn/helpers/file_panel_loader.py`

**Wired Controllers Together:**
```python
# In _init_project_controller():
if self.file_explorer and hasattr(self.file_explorer, 'controller'):
    self.project_controller.set_file_panel_controller(self.file_explorer.controller)
    self.file_explorer.controller.on_project_opened = self._on_project_opened_from_file_panel
```

**New Callback Handler:**
```python
def _on_project_opened_from_file_panel(self, project_path):
    """Handle project opening from file panel selection."""
    project_manager = get_project_manager()
    project = project_manager.open_project_by_path(project_path)
    if project:
        self.project_controller._on_project_opened(project)
```

## Architecture Pattern

### MVC Flow for Project Opening:

```
User Action (View)
    ↓
FilePanelController (Controller)
    ↓
on_project_opened callback
    ↓
FilePanelLoader._on_project_opened_from_file_panel
    ↓
ProjectManager.open_project_by_path (Model)
    ↓
ProjectActionsController._on_project_opened (Controller)
    ↓
Update UI state & notify app
```

### Component Responsibilities:

**FilePanelController (UI Logic):**
- Detects project files/folders in tree
- Manages "project opening mode" state
- Triggers callbacks when project selected

**ProjectActionsController (Business Logic):**
- Coordinates between UI and data model
- Delegates to file panel or dialog manager
- Updates button states

**ProjectManager (Data Model):**
- Loads project from file
- Manages project state
- Persists project data

**FilePanelLoader (Integration):**
- Wires controllers together
- Handles callbacks
- Manages component lifecycle

## Benefits

✅ **No Dialogs:** Direct selection in familiar file tree  
✅ **Intuitive:** Double-click behavior matches file managers  
✅ **Flexible:** Three methods for different workflows  
✅ **Clean State:** "Opening mode" is explicit and visible  
✅ **Backward Compatible:** Dialog still available as fallback  

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing:

- [ ] **Double-click .shy file:** Opens project directly
- [ ] **Double-click project folder:** Finds and opens .shy file
- [ ] **Open Project button:** Enters mode, shows "SELECT PROJECT TO OPEN..."
- [ ] **Select project in mode:** Opens project and exits mode
- [ ] **Normal folders:** Still navigate (no .shy file inside)
- [ ] **Regular files:** Still open in canvas (not .shy files)

### Edge Cases:

- [ ] **Empty folder:** Double-click navigates normally
- [ ] **Multiple .shy files:** Opens first found (predictable)
- [ ] **Nested projects:** Each folder checked independently
- [ ] **Cancel mode:** (Future: ESC key or click elsewhere)

### Error Handling:

- [ ] **Corrupt .shy file:** Error message, doesn't crash
- [ ] **Permission denied:** Error message shown
- [ ] **Missing dependencies:** Graceful degradation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Indicators:**
   - Icon for project folders in tree
   - Highlight project folders differently
   - Special icon for `.shy` files

2. **Mode Cancellation:**
   - ESC key exits project opening mode
   - Click on empty space cancels mode
   - Timeout after 30 seconds

3. **Recent Projects:**
   - Show recent projects at top of tree
   - Quick access section in file panel
   - MRU (Most Recently Used) list

4. **Project Preview:**
   - Hover tooltip shows project info
   - Metadata preview on selection
   - Thumbnail if available

5. **Multi-Project:**
   - Open multiple projects simultaneously
   - Switch between open projects
   - Project workspace tabs

## Related Components

- **Project System:** `src/shypn/data/project_models.py`
- **Project Dialogs:** `src/shypn/helpers/project_dialog_manager.py`
- **File Explorer API:** `src/shypn/file/`
- **Import Flow Fix:** `doc/IMPORT_FLOW_FIX.md` (also avoided premature saves)

## Migration Notes

This feature maintains backward compatibility:
- Dialog-based opening still works if file_panel_controller is not set
- Existing code using ProjectDialogManager unchanged
- Can gradually migrate other parts to use tree-based selection

## Code Quality

- ✅ All files compile without syntax errors
- ✅ Follows existing MVC pattern
- ✅ Error handling with try-except blocks
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Callbacks for loose coupling
