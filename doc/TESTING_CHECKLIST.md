4. Click P1 second (place as target)

**Expected Terminal Output**:
```
Arc creation: source T1 selected
Created A1: T1 â†’ P1
```

**Visual Check**:
- âœ“ Arc created in reverse direction
- âœ“ Arrowhead points toward P1

**Status**: ðŸ”„ READY TO TEST

---

## âœ… Test 5: Bipartite Validation (Pâ†’P Invalid)

**Steps**:
1. Create P1 and P2 (two places)
2. Click [A] button
3. Click P1
4. Click P2 â†’ Should show error

**Expected Terminal Output**:
```
Arc creation: source P1 selected
Cannot create arc: Invalid connection: Place â†’ Place. Arcs must connect Placeâ†”Transition (bipartite property). Valid connections: Placeâ†’Transition or Transitionâ†’Place.
```

**Visual Check**:
- âœ“ Orange preview line shows while hovering
- âœ“ NO arc is created after clicking P2
- âœ“ Error message in terminal
- âœ“ Can start new arc (source reset)

**Status**: ðŸ”„ READY TO TEST

---

## âœ… Test 6: Bipartite Validation (Tâ†’T Invalid)

**Steps**:
1. Create T1 and T2 (two transitions)
2. Try to create arc T1 â†’ T2

**Expected Terminal Output**:
```
Arc creation: source T1 selected
Cannot create arc: Invalid connection: Transition â†’ Transition. Arcs must connect Placeâ†”Transition (bipartite property). Valid connections: Placeâ†’Transition or Transitionâ†’Place.
```

**Status**: ðŸ”„ READY TO TEST

---

## âœ… Test 7: Arc Creation Reset

**Steps**:
1. Create P1
2. Click [A] button
3. Click P1 â†’ Source selected
4. Click on EMPTY SPACE â†’ Should reset

**Expected Terminal Output**:
```
Arc creation: source P1 selected
(No error, just resets silently)
```

**Visual Check**:
- âœ“ Orange preview line disappears
- âœ“ Can click P1 again to start new arc

**Status**: ðŸ”„ READY TO TEST

---

## âœ… Test 8: Preview Line Geometry

**Steps**:
1. Create P1 (place with radius ~20px)
2. Click [A] button
3. Click P1
4. Move cursor in circle around P1
5. Observe where preview line starts

**Visual Check**:
- âœ“ Preview line starts at BOUNDARY of P1 (20px from center)
- âœ“ Line always points toward cursor
- âœ“ Arrowhead rotates smoothly
- âœ“ Orange color clearly visible (RGB: 0.95, 0.5, 0.1)

**Status**: ðŸ”„ READY TO TEST

## âœ… Test 9: Multiple Arcs

**Steps**:
1. Create: P1, T1, P2, T2
2. Create arcs:
   - P1 â†’ T1
   - T1 â†’ P2

   - T2 â†’ P1 (creates cycle)

**Expected Terminal Output**:
```
Created A1: P1 â†’ T1
Created A2: T1 â†’ P2
Created A3: P2 â†’ T2
Created A4: T2 â†’ P1
```

## Bug Fixes Applied

### âœ… Fix 1: Missing Imports (COMPLETED)

**Error**:
```
NameError: name 'Place' is not defined
```

**Fix**:
Added imports in `model_canvas_loader.py`:
```python
import math  # For sqrt, atan2, cos, sin in preview rendering
from shypn.netobjs import Place, Transition, Arc  # For isinstance checks
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/shypn/helpers/model_canvas_loader.py`

**Status**: âœ… FIXED

---

## Current Status

### Implemented Features âœ…
- âœ… Object selection (left-click toggle)
- âœ… Arc creation (two-click with [A] tool)
- âœ… Arc preview line (orange, follows cursor)
- âœ… Bipartite validation (Pâ†”T only)
- âœ… Hit testing (find object at position)
- âœ… Preview line geometry (starts at boundary)

### Known Issues
- None currently (fix applied)

### Ready for Testing
All features are now ready for comprehensive testing!
