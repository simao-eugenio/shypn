# OOP Refactoring: Left Panel Project Management

## Date: 2025-01-XX

## Overview
Refactored the left panel loader to follow proper OOP principles with clean separation of concerns. The loader is now minimal (321 lines vs 398 lines), with project management logic extracted into a dedicated controller.

## Problem
The original `left_panel_loader.py` violated the Single Responsibility Principle by mixing:
- UI loading and state management (loader responsibility)
- Project management business logic (controller responsibility)  
- Direct dialog instantiation and callback handling

This made the code harder to:
- Test (business logic coupled to UI)
- Reuse (project management tied to left panel)
- Maintain (responsibilities unclear)

## Solution: Controller Pattern

### Architecture (Following OOP)
```
LeftPanelLoader (Minimal - 321 lines)
├── UI Loading & State Management
├── Float/Attach Behavior
└── Integration via Composition:
    ├── FileExplorerPanel (file browsing)
    └── ProjectActionsController (project management) ← NEW
        └── ProjectDialogManager (dialogs)
            └── ProjectManager (data/persistence)
```

### New Component: ProjectActionsController
**File**: `src/shypn/helpers/project_actions_controller.py` (220 lines)

**Responsibilities**:
- Connect project management buttons to handlers
- Coordinate between dialogs and data models
- Provide callbacks for integration (loose coupling)
- Manage project lifecycle events

**Key Design**:
- **Separation**: No UI loading, no dialogs, no persistence
- **Composition**: Uses ProjectDialogManager via dependency injection
- **Integration**: Callbacks for loose coupling with parent components
- **Reusability**: Can be used by any component needing project management

**API**:
```python
class ProjectActionsController:
    # Callbacks for integration (set by parent)
    on_project_created: callable  # (project) -> None
    on_project_opened: callable   # (project) -> None
    on_project_closed: callable   # () -> None
    
    # Public methods
    def set_parent_window(window)
    def update_project_state()
    def get_current_project() -> Optional[Project]
    def close_current_project()
```

### Refactored: LeftPanelLoader
**File**: `src/shypn/helpers/left_panel_loader.py` (321 lines, was 398)

**Changes**:
1. **Removed** (~77 lines):
   - `_connect_project_buttons()` - moved to controller
   - `_on_new_project_clicked()` - moved to controller
   - `_on_open_project_clicked()` - moved to controller
   - `_on_project_settings_clicked()` - moved to controller
   - `_on_quit_clicked()` - moved to controller
   - Duplicate callback methods
   - Direct ProjectDialogManager instantiation
   - Direct ProjectManager reference

2. **Added**:
   - `self.project_controller = ProjectActionsController(...)` - composition
   - Minimal integration callbacks (just update file explorer navigation)

3. **Kept**:
   - UI loading and builder management
   - Float/attach behavior
   - Window state management
   - File explorer integration

**Integration Pattern** (Minimal - just navigation):
```python
# In load():
self.project_controller = ProjectActionsController(self.builder, parent_window=self.window)
self.project_controller.on_project_created = self._on_project_created
self.project_controller.on_project_opened = self._on_project_opened
self.project_controller.on_project_closed = self._on_project_closed

# Callbacks (3-5 lines each):
def _on_project_created(self, project):
    if self.file_explorer and project:
        self.file_explorer.set_base_path(project.base_path)
```

## Benefits

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
- **LeftPanelLoader**: Only UI loading, window state, float/attach behavior
- **ProjectActionsController**: Only project management coordination
- **ProjectDialogManager**: Only dialog presentation
- **ProjectManager**: Only data/persistence

### 2. Testability
- Controller can be tested independently without UI
- Mock callbacks to test integration
- No GTK dependencies in business logic tests

### 3. Reusability
- Controller can be used in other contexts (toolbar, menu bar, etc.)
- Dialog manager already reusable
- Clear API for integration

### 4. Maintainability
- Each class has one clear purpose
- Changes to project management don't affect loader
- Changes to UI don't affect business logic
- Easier to locate bugs

## Code Metrics

### Before
- `left_panel_loader.py`: 398 lines
- Mixed responsibilities: 4 (loader, project buttons, dialogs, data)
- Direct dependencies: ProjectDialogManager, ProjectManager
- Integration: Tight coupling

### After
- `left_panel_loader.py`: 321 lines (-77)
- `project_actions_controller.py`: 220 lines (new)
- Responsibilities per file: 1
- Integration: Loose coupling via callbacks
- Net change: +143 lines total (but proper separation)

## Related Changes

### Directory Structure (Prerequisite)
This refactoring was done as part of the directory structure cleanup:
- `models/` → `examples/` (demo files)
- `data/projects/` → `projects/` (user projects)
- Created `cache/` for transient data

### File Updates
1. `src/shypn/data/project_models.py`:
   - Line 417: Changed path from `'data', 'projects'` to `'projects'`
   
2. `src/shypn/helpers/left_panel_loader.py`:
   - Line 50: Changed base_path from `'models'` to `'examples'`
   - Removed ~77 lines of project management code
   - Added ProjectActionsController integration

3. `src/shypn/helpers/project_actions_controller.py`:
   - NEW: 220 lines
   - Complete controller implementation

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify project creation works (creates in `projects/`)
- [ ] Verify project opening works
- [ ] Verify project settings dialog works
- [ ] Verify file explorer navigates to project on open/create
- [ ] Verify file explorer returns to examples on close
- [ ] Verify quit button still works
- [ ] Verify float/attach still works
- [ ] Verify no errors in console

## Future Improvements
1. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for ProjectActionsController
2. **Quit Handler**: Move quit logic to application level (not in panel)
3. **Project State**: Add visual indicators for open project
4. **Recent Projects**: Improve recent projects menu
5. **Error Handling**: Better error messages in controller

## Lessons Learned
1. **Start with architecture**: Define responsibilities before coding
2. **Compose, don't inherit**: Use composition for flexibility
3. **Minimal loaders**: Loaders should only load UI and manage state
4. **Callbacks for integration**: Avoid direct coupling between components
5. **Clear naming**: Controller vs Loader vs Manager - names matter
6. **Document patterns**: Architecture docs prevent future violations
