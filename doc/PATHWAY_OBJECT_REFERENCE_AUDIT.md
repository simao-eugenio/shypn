# Pathway Object Reference Architecture Audit & Fix

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Branch**: `feature/property-dialogs-and-simulation-palette`  
**Context**: Global audit after enforcing object reference architecture rule

## Overview

After establishing the strong rule that "net objects must be referenced, not accessed by ID/name", we conducted a comprehensive audit of all pathway/import code to ensure compliance. This document details the audit findings and fixes applied.

## Issues Found

### Issue #1: Rate Function Building Using Strings Instead of Objects ⚠️

**Location**: `src/shypn/data/pathway/pathway_converter.py`

**Problem**: The `ReactionConverter._setup_michaelis_menten()` and `_setup_mass_action()` methods were building lists of place **names** (strings) instead of working with place **objects**.

#### Before (WRONG ❌):

```python
# Get all substrate places
substrate_refs = []
for species_id, stoich in reaction.reactants:
    place = self.species_to_place.get(species_id)
    if place:
        substrate_refs.append(place.name)  # ❌ Storing string!

# Later usage
rate_func = f"michaelis_menten({substrate_refs[0]}, {vmax}, {km})"
```

**Why This Was Wrong**:
1. Immediately extracted `.name` string from place object
2. Lost object reference - only had strings in the list
3. Violated object reference architecture principle
4. Made code harder to reason about (working with strings, not objects)

#### After (CORRECT ✅):

```python
# Get all substrate places (use place objects, not names/IDs)
substrate_places = []
for species_id, stoich in reaction.reactants:
    place = self.species_to_place.get(species_id)
    if place:
        substrate_places.append(place)  # ✅ Storing object!

# Later usage - extract name only when building the string formula
rate_func = f"michaelis_menten({substrate_places[0].name}, {vmax}, {km})"
```

**Why This Is Correct**:
1. Maintains object references throughout the code
2. Only extracts `.name` when actually needed (for formula string)
3. Code works with objects, not strings
4. Follows object reference architecture
5. More maintainable and less error-prone

**Note**: Using `.name` in the formula string itself is acceptable because:
- The formula is a **string representation** for evaluation
- It's not used for object lookup or reference
- It's the final step before creating the immutable string
- The simulation engine uses these names as variable identifiers

### Affected Methods

1. **`ReactionConverter._setup_michaelis_menten()`** (lines ~285-325):
   - Changed `substrate_refs` list to `substrate_places` list
   - Now stores Place objects instead of name strings
   - Extracts `.name` only when building formula string

2. **`ReactionConverter._setup_mass_action()`** (lines ~355-370):
   - Changed `reactant_refs` list to `reactant_places` list
   - Now stores Place objects instead of name strings
   - Extracts `.name` only when building formula string

## Audit Results by Category

### ✅ Correct Usage Patterns Found

1. **Arc Creation with Object References**:
```python
# KEGG arc_builder.py - CORRECT ✅
arc = Arc(place, transition, arc_id, "", weight=weight)
#         ^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^  (object references, not IDs)

# pathway_converter.py ArcConverter - CORRECT ✅
arc = self.document.create_arc(
    source=place,       # Object reference
    target=transition,  # Object reference
    weight=weight
)
```

2. **Dictionary Lookups During Conversion** (Acceptable ✅):
```python
# Temporary lookup dictionaries are acceptable
species_to_place = {}
species_to_place[species.id] = place  # Key is ID, value is object

# Later use - gets object back
place = species_to_place.get(species_id)
arc = Arc(source=place, target=transition)  # Uses object
```

This pattern is acceptable because:
- Dictionary is temporary (only during conversion)
- Values are object references
- Keys are only used for lookup, not storage
- Objects are retrieved and used as references

3. **Metadata Storage** (Acceptable ✅):
```python
# Storing IDs in metadata for traceability is acceptable
place.metadata['species_id'] = species.id
arc.metadata['kegg_compound'] = substrate.name
```

This is acceptable because:
- Metadata is for documentation/debugging
- Not used for object relationships
- Doesn't violate object reference architecture

### ⚠️ Patterns That Needed Review (But Were Acceptable)

1. **Rate Function Formula Strings**:
```python
# This is acceptable - formula is a string, not an object reference
rate_func = f"michaelis_menten({place.name}, {vmax}, {km})"
transition.properties['rate_function'] = rate_func
```

**Why acceptable**: The formula is a string representation for simulation. The name is used as a variable identifier in the mathematical expression, not as an object lookup key.

2. **ID-based Dictionaries During Deserialization**:
```python
# document_model.py from_dict() - Acceptable ✅
places_dict = {}
for place_data in data.get("places", []):
    place = Place.from_dict(place_data)
    document.places.append(place)
    places_dict[place.id] = place  # Temporary lookup
```

**Why acceptable**: This is a temporary dictionary used only during deserialization to resolve arc references. Once deserialization is complete, the dictionary is discarded and all arcs hold object references.

## Changes Made

### File: `src/shypn/data/pathway/pathway_converter.py`

**Lines ~285-289**: Changed variable name and storage pattern
```python
# Before:
substrate_refs = []
# ... 
substrate_refs.append(place.name)  # ❌

# After:
substrate_places = []
# ...
substrate_places.append(place)  # ✅
```

**Lines ~292-325**: Updated to use object references
```python
# Before:
if not substrate_refs:
    # ...
rate_func = f"michaelis_menten({substrate_refs[0]}, {vmax}, {km})"

# After:
if not substrate_places:
    # ...
rate_func = f"michaelis_menten({substrate_places[0].name}, {vmax}, {km})"
```

**Lines ~355-370**: Same pattern for mass action
```python
# Before:
reactant_refs = []
# ...
reactant_refs.append(place.name)  # ❌
rate_func = f"mass_action({reactant_refs[0]}, {reactant_refs[1]}, {k})"

# After:
reactant_places = []
# ...
reactant_places.append(place)  # ✅
rate_func = f"mass_action({reactant_places[0].name}, {reactant_places[1].name}, {k})"
```

## Architecture Validation

### Object Reference Checklist ✅

- [x] Arcs use object references (not IDs/names) ✅
- [x] Place/Transition creation uses objects ✅
- [x] Lookup dictionaries return objects ✅
- [x] Rate functions built from objects (extract name at last moment) ✅
- [x] No ID-based permanent lookups ✅
- [x] No name-based permanent lookups ✅
- [x] Temporary dictionaries only during conversion ✅
- [x] Serialization uses IDs (acceptable exception) ✅
- [x] Deserialization restores object references ✅

### Key Principles Confirmed

1. **Object-First Approach**: Work with objects, extract properties only when needed
2. **Late Property Extraction**: Get `.name` or `.id` only at the last moment
3. **Temporary Lookups OK**: Dictionaries with ID keys are acceptable if temporary
4. **String Formulas OK**: Using names in formula strings is acceptable (they're not for lookup)
5. **Metadata OK**: Storing IDs/names in metadata for debugging is acceptable

## Conclusion

**Summary**:
- ✅ 1 issue found and fixed in `pathway_converter.py`
- ✅ All other code already compliant with object reference architecture
- ✅ KEGG import: Clean ✅
- ✅ SBML import: Clean ✅
- ✅ File operations: Clean ✅
- ✅ Core model: Clean ✅

**Impact**:
- More maintainable code (work with objects, not strings)
- Consistent with architecture rules
- Less error-prone (type safety)
- Easier to reason about

**Recommendation**: Continue following the object-first principle:
1. Store object references
2. Work with objects
3. Extract properties (.name, .id) only when absolutely needed
4. Use temporary ID-based lookups only during conversion/deserialization
