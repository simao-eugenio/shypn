**Total Project Tests**: **25/25 PASSED**

## Quick Overview

Phase 4 implements **hybrid discrete-continuous Petri net simulation**, allowing both instantaneous events (discrete transitions) and continuous flow processes (continuous transitions) to coexist in a single model.

## Key Implementation

### Hybrid Step Execution

```python
def step(self, time_step=0.1):
    """Hybrid discrete + continuous execution."""
    # 1. Update enablement states
    self._update_enablement_states()
    
    # 2. Identify continuous transitions (BEFORE discrete changes)
    continuous_to_integrate = [(t, behavior, arcs) 
                               for t in continuous 
                               if can_flow]
    
    # 3. Execute discrete transition (ONE fires)
    if enabled_discrete:
        transition = self._select_transition(enabled_discrete)
        self._fire_transition(transition)
    
    # 4. Integrate continuous transitions (ALL pre-identified)
    for transition, behavior, arcs in continuous_to_integrate:
        behavior.integrate_step(dt=time_step, ...)
    
    # 5. Advance time
    self.time += time_step
```

### Critical Design: Continuous Enablement Snapshot

Continuous transitions are identified **BEFORE** discrete transitions fire:
- Ensures consistency (based on initial state)
- Maintains locality independence
- Prevents race conditions

## Test Results

### Phase 4 Tests (5 tests)

| Test | Purpose | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| `test_continuous_integration` | Basic continuous flow | ✅ PASSED |
| `test_hybrid_discrete_continuous` | Mixed discrete + continuous | ✅ PASSED |
| `test_parallel_locality_independence` | Parallel paths | ✅ PASSED |
| `test_continuous_depletion` | Source exhaustion | ✅ PASSED |
| `test_continuous_rate_function` | Rate evaluation | ✅ PASSED |

### Backward Compatibility

✅ Phase 1: Behavior Integration (7/7 tests)  
✅ Phase 2: Conflict Resolution (7/7 tests)  
✅ Phase 3: Time-Aware Behaviors (6/6 tests)  
✅ Phase 4: Continuous Integration (5/5 tests)

**Total: 25/25 tests passing**

## Features Delivered

### ✅ Hybrid Execution
- Discrete transitions fire atomically (one per step)
- Continuous transitions integrate in parallel (all enabled)
- Clean separation between types

### ✅ Locality Independence
- Parallel discrete and continuous paths don't interfere
- Independent token conservation in each path
- Simultaneous execution maintained

### ✅ Numerical Integration
- RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4th order) for continuous flow
- Stable and accurate integration
- Token conservation maintained (within floating-point precision)

### ✅ Enablement Consistency
- Continuous enablement checked before discrete firing
- Snapshot-based execution for predictability
- No mid-step state dependencies

## Key Achievements

1. **Hybrid Semantics**: Correctly implements mathematical definition of hybrid Petri nets
2. **Numerical Stability**: RK4 integration provides 4th-order accuracy
3. **Locality Principle**: Discrete and continuous transitions in separate localities are independent
4. **Token Conservation**: Exact conservation (within numerical precision) throughout
5. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive test coverage, robust error handling

## Code Structure

**Modified Files**:
- `src/shypn/engine/simulation/controller.py`: Rewrote `step()` for hybrid execution

**New Files**:
- `tests/test_phase4_continuous.py`: 558 lines, 5 comprehensive tests
- `doc/phase4_continuous_integration.md`: Complete technical documentation
- `doc/phase4_summary.md`: This summary

## Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(T_d + T_c) per step
  - T_d = discrete transitions (one selected)
  - T_c = continuous transitions (all integrate)

- **Integration Cost**: 4 × T_c rate evaluations per step (RK4)

- **Memory**: O(T) for transition state tracking

## Example Usage

```python
# Create hybrid net with discrete and continuous transitions
model = create_hybrid_net()
controller = SimulationController(model)

# Run simulation
while controller.step(time_step=0.1):
    print(f"Time: {controller.time:.2f}")
    for place in model.places:
        print(f"  {place.name}: {place.tokens:.2f}")
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Snapshot Continuous Enablement First?

✅ **Chosen**: Check continuous BEFORE discrete fires  
❌ **Rejected**: Check continuous AFTER discrete fires

**Rationale**: Ensures continuous integration is based on initial state, maintaining consistency and locality independence.

### Why RK4 Integration?

✅ **Chosen**: Runge-Kutta 4th order  
❌ **Rejected**: Euler (1st order), RK2 (2nd order)

**Rationale**: Good accuracy/cost balance, stable, exact for constant rates.

## Future Opportunities

Potential enhancements for Phase 5+:
- Adaptive time stepping (variable dt)
- Higher-order integration methods
- Stiff system solvers
- Parallel execution of continuous transitions
- Hybrid events (discrete triggers from continuous thresholds)
