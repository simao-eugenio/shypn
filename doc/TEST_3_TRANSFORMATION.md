# Test 3: Arc Transformation (Normal → Inhibitor)

**Current Test**: Transform arc and verify immediate update

---

## ✅ Test 2 Result: PASSED!

Context menu is working correctly:
- ✅ "Transform Arc ►" submenu appears
- ✅ "Convert to Inhibitor Arc" option present (for Place → Transition)
- ✅ "Edit Weight..." option present

---

## Test 3: Transform the Arc

### What to Do:

1. **Right-click** on the arc again
2. Select **"Transform Arc ►"**
3. Click **"Convert to Inhibitor Arc"**
4. **Watch carefully** what happens to the arc

---

## What to Check:

### ✅ Visual Changes:
- Arc should change from **normal arrowhead** (►) to **hollow circle** (○) at the endpoint
- The hollow circle indicates inhibitor arc

### ✅ Connection Quality:
- Arc should still connect at object edges (perimeter + border_width/2)
- No gaps or overlaps

### ✅ Atomic Transformation:
- Change should be **immediate** (no flicker)
- No intermediate states visible
- Entire arc transforms at once

---

## Expected Result:

**Before**: Normal arc with arrowhead
```
Place ━━━━━━━━━━━━━►■ Transition
```

**After**: Inhibitor arc with hollow circle
```
Place ━━━━━━━━━━━━━○■ Transition
```

---

## How to Report:

**Option 1** - Works perfectly:
> ✅ "Transformed immediately, hollow circle appeared at endpoint, still connects at edges"

**Option 2** - Visual issue:
> ⚠️ "Transformed but [describe issue, e.g., 'circle not hollow' or 'gap appeared']"

**Option 3** - Not working:
> ❌ "Nothing happened" or "Error occurred"

---

## After This Test:

Next tests:
- Test 4: Edit weight and see label
- Test 5: Interactive curve toggle
- Test 6: Undo/redo transformation

**Ready?** Transform the arc to inhibitor and let me know what you see! 🚀
