## What Was Implemented (Phase 4)

### 1. Hybrid Step Execution

Modified `SimulationController.step()` to execute both discrete and continuous transitions:

```python
def step(self, time_step=0.1):
    # 1. Update enablement states
    self._update_enablement_states()
    
    # 2. Identify continuous transitions (BEFORE discrete)
    continuous_to_integrate = [...]
    
    # 3. Fire discrete transition (ONE)
    self._fire_transition(selected_discrete)
    
    # 4. Integrate continuous transitions (ALL)
    for continuous in continuous_to_integrate:
        behavior.integrate_step(dt=time_step)
    
    # 5. Advance time
    self.time += time_step
```

### 2. Key Design: Continuous Enablement Snapshot

**Critical Decision**: Check continuous enablement **BEFORE** discrete transitions fire.

**Why?**
- Ensures consistency (based on initial state)
- Maintains locality independence
- Prevents race conditions
- Predictable behavior

### 3. Numerical Integration

Continuous transitions use **RK4 (Runge-Kutta 4th order)**:
- 4th-order accuracy
- Stable for typical systems
- Exact for constant rates

## Phase 4 Test Coverage

### 5 Comprehensive Tests

1. **test_continuous_integration**
   - Basic continuous flow: P1 → T1(rate=2.0) → P2
   - Validates token transfer and conservation

2. **test_hybrid_discrete_continuous**
   - Mixed network: P1 → T1(immediate) → P2 → T2(continuous) → P3
   - Validates discrete and continuous coexistence

3. **test_parallel_locality_independence**
   - Two independent paths (discrete and continuous)
   - Validates parallel execution without interference

4. **test_continuous_depletion**
   - Source exhaustion: P1(10.0) depletes over 5.0 seconds
   - Validates stopping when source empty

5. **test_continuous_rate_function**
   - Rate evaluation mechanism
   - Validates rate function access

## Key Technical Achievements

### ✅ Hybrid Execution Semantics

Correctly implements mathematical definition of hybrid Petri nets:
- Discrete transitions: atomic firing
- Continuous transitions: smooth integration
- Clean separation of execution

### ✅ Locality Independence

Parallel paths don't interfere:
- Discrete path operates independently
- Continuous path operates independently
- Both execute simultaneously

### ✅ Numerical Stability

RK4 integration provides:
- 4th-order accuracy
- Token conservation (within numerical precision)
- Stable for typical rates

### ✅ Enablement Consistency

Snapshot-based approach ensures:
- Continuous integration based on initial state
- No mid-step dependencies
- Predictable behavior
