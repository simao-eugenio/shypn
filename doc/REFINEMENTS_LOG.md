## October 2, 2025 - Repository Cleanup and Debug Removal

### Repository Organization

**Test Files Consolidation**
- Moved 8 test files from `scripts/` to `tests/` directory:
  - `test_context_menu.py`
  - `test_file_explorer.py`
  - `test_file_operations.py`
  - `test_gesture_simple.py`
  - `test_popover_methods.py`
  - `test_relative_paths.py`
  - `test_right_click.py`
  - `test_transition_dialog.py`

**Transition Files Cleanup**
- Removed all `transition*` files from main directories (5 files):
  - `ui/palettes/transition_enhanced.ui`
  - `ui/panels/transition.ui`
  - `ui/dialogs/transition_properties.ui`
  - `ui/dialogs/transition_properties.ui.backup`
  - `tests/test_transition_dialog.py`
- Preparing for fresh import from legacy folder

### Debug Code Removal

**Objective**: Remove all debug print statements while preserving ERROR messages for critical failures.

**Files Cleaned (8 files)**:

1. **src/shypn.py**
   - Removed: ‚úì success messages, WARNING messages
   - Kept: ERROR messages with `file=sys.stderr`
   - Fixed: Empty except blocks with `pass` statements

2. **src/shypn/helpers/model_canvas_loader.py**
   - Removed: ‚úì, ‚Üí, üñ±Ô∏è, ‚ö† debug prints (~20+ print statements)
   - Fixed: Empty else/elif blocks
   - Cleaned: Canvas interaction logging, validation warnings

3. **src/shypn/helpers/left_panel_loader.py**
   - Removed: ‚úì, ‚Üí status messages
   - Kept: ERROR messages for GTK import and file explorer failures

4. **src/shypn/helpers/right_panel_loader.py**
   - Removed: ‚úì, ‚Üí status messages (~15 print statements)
   - Fixed: Empty except blocks

5. **src/shypn/ui/panels/file_explorer_panel.py**
   - Removed: ‚úì, ‚Üí, üñ±Ô∏è, ‚úó, üìã, ‚úÇ, üîÑ debug prints (~40+ print statements)
   - Cleaned: File operations logging, context menu debugging, right-click tracking
   - Fixed: Multiple empty if/else blocks

6. **src/shypn/helpers/predefined_zoom.py**
   - Removed: ‚úì initialization messages
   - Kept: ERROR messages

7. **src/shypn/dev/example_dev.py**
   - Removed: Test print statement
   - Replaced with `pass` placeholder

8. **src/shypn/api/file/explorer.py**
   - Removed: Example print statement from docstring

**Technical Fixes Applied**:
- Added `pass` statements to empty `except`, `else`, `elif` blocks
- Fixed IndentationError issues in multiple files
- Ensured all files compile successfully with `python3 -m py_compile`

**Verification**:
- ‚úÖ Application starts with zero console output
- ‚úÖ All ERROR messages preserved for debugging critical failures
- ‚úÖ No remaining debug symbols (‚úì, ‚Üí, üñ±Ô∏è, ‚úó, ‚ö†, üìã, ‚úÇ, üîÑ)
- ‚úÖ All Python files compile without errors

**Impact**:
- Cleaner production-ready codebase
- No performance overhead from debug logging
- Professional console output (errors only)
- Easier to spot real issues in logs

## October 1, 2025 - Right Panel Refinements and Grid Fixes

## Issue 1: Empty Right Panel Visible on Startup

### Problem
On application startup, an empty right panel (thin vertical area) was visible on the right side of the window, even though the toggle button was inactive.

### Root Cause
In `ui/main/main_window.ui`, the `right_paned` widget had:
```xml
<property name="position">800</property>
```

The window's default width is 800px. Setting the paned position to exactly 800 meant the divider was at the right edge, but because the `right_dock_area` has `width-request="0"` and the paned is trying to honor both sides, a thin sliver was visible.

### Solution
Changed the `right_paned` position to a large value (10000) to ensure it's always collapsed on startup:
```xml
<property name="position">10000</property>
```

When the right panel is activated via the toggle button, the code dynamically calculates the correct position:
```python
paned_width = right_paned.get_width()
if paned_width > 280:
    right_paned.set_position(paned_width - 280)
```

## Issue 2: Grid Cells Too Large on Startup (~30mm instead of ~5mm)

### Problem
At 100% zoom (zoom=1.0), grid cells appeared to be approximately 30mm wide instead of the expected 5mm (~20 pixels at 96 DPI).

### Root Cause
The `get_grid_spacing()` method in `ModelCanvasManager` was iterating through subdivision levels in **reverse order**:

```python
for level in reversed(self.GRID_SUBDIVISION_LEVELS):  # [10, 5, 2, 1]
    spacing = base_spacing * level
    screen_spacing = spacing * self.zoom
    if screen_spacing >= 10:
        return spacing  # Would return 200 at zoom=1.0!
```

With `GRID_SUBDIVISION_LEVELS = [1, 2, 5, 10]` and `BASE_GRID_SPACING = 20`:
- At zoom=1.0, the reversed iteration checked level=10 first
- spacing = 20 √ó 10 = 200
- screen_spacing = 200 √ó 1.0 = 200 pixels ‚úì (>= 10)
- **Returned 200**, which is 10√ó too large!

The algorithm was selecting the **largest** spacing that met the threshold instead of the **smallest**.

### Solution
Removed the `reversed()` call to iterate in ascending order:

```python
for level in self.GRID_SUBDIVISION_LEVELS:  # [1, 2, 5, 10]
    spacing = base_spacing * level
    screen_spacing = spacing * self.zoom
    if screen_spacing >= 10:
        return spacing  # Now returns 20 at zoom=1.0 ‚úì
```

Now at zoom=1.0:
- level=1: spacing=20, screen_spacing=20 ‚úì (>= 10)
- **Returns 20** immediately ‚úì

### Behavior at Different Zoom Levels
With the corrected algorithm:

| Zoom | Level Selected | World Spacing | Screen Spacing | Approx. Size |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 0.3  | 2             | 40            | 12 px          | ~10mm        |
| 0.5  | 1             | 20            | 10 px          | ~5mm         |
| 1.0  | 1             | 20            | 20 px          | ~5mm         |
| 2.0  | 1             | 20            | 40 px          | ~10mm        |
| 5.0  | 1             | 20            | 100 px         | ~26mm        |

The grid adapts by selecting progressively larger spacing as you zoom out, preventing cluttered overlapping lines while maintaining at least 10 pixels between lines on screen.

## Testing

Both issues have been fixed and tested. The application now:
1. ‚úÖ Starts with no empty panels visible (both left and right panels hidden)
2. ‚úÖ Displays grid at correct 100% zoom with ~5mm cells (20px at 96 DPI)
3. ‚úÖ Pan behavior remains smooth and relative
4. ‚úÖ Three grid styles available (line, dot, cross)

## Related Changes from Previous Session

These refinements build on the previous session where we implemented:
- Viewport centering on startup
- Incremental delta tracking for smooth pan
- Alternative grid patterns (line/dot/cross)
- Grid style API methods (`set_grid_style`, `cycle_grid_style`)
