# Zoom and Scaling - Quick Testing Guide

## Testing Procedure

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd /home/simao/projetos/shypn
python3 src/shypn.py
```

### 2. Create Test Objects

**Create a few objects to test zoom**:
1. Click **[P]** button ‚Üí Click canvas to create places (create 3-4)
2. Click **[T]** button ‚Üí Click canvas to create transitions (create 3-4)
3. Click **[A]** button ‚Üí Click place ‚Üí Click transition to create arcs

**Expected**: You should have a small Petri net with several connected objects.

## Test Cases

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Basic Zoom In/Out

**Steps**:
1. Position cursor over an object
2. Scroll wheel **UP** (or trackpad pinch out)
3. Observe objects zoom in (get larger)
4. Scroll wheel **DOWN** (or trackpad pinch in)
5. Observe objects zoom out (get smaller)

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Objects scale smoothly (bigger/smaller)
- ‚úÖ Line widths stay constant (3px borders always)
- ‚úÖ Text stays readable (12pt/14pt font)
- ‚úÖ Object under cursor stays at same screen position

**Common Issues**:
- ‚ùå Objects jump around ‚Üí Coordinate transformation bug
- ‚ùå Lines get thicker/thinner ‚Üí Missing zoom compensation
- ‚ùå Text becomes huge/tiny ‚Üí Font size not compensated

---

### ‚úÖ Test 2: Pointer-Centered Zoom

**Steps**:
1. Position cursor at **canvas center** ‚Üí Scroll to zoom
2. Position cursor at **top-left corner** ‚Üí Scroll to zoom
3. Position cursor over **specific place** ‚Üí Scroll to zoom

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Zoom always centers on cursor position
- ‚úÖ Object under cursor doesn't move in screen space
- ‚úÖ Rest of canvas scales around cursor

**Test Verification**:
- At center: Canvas expands/contracts from center
- At corner: Corner stays fixed, rest scales away
- Over object: Object stays under cursor, others scale

---

### ‚úÖ Test 3: Extreme Zoom Levels

**Steps**:
1. Zoom in **as far as possible** (10+ scroll ups)
2. Check that zoom stops at maximum (1000%)
3. Zoom out **as far as possible** (10+ scroll downs)
4. Check that zoom stops at minimum (10%)

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Maximum zoom: Objects very large, lines still 3px
- ‚úÖ Minimum zoom: Objects very small, lines still 3px
- ‚úÖ Zoom clamps at limits (no further zooming)
- ‚úÖ No visual artifacts or rendering errors

---

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Object Scaling

**At 100% Zoom** (default):
- Place radius: ~20px
- Transition size: ~40x20px
- Arc line width: 3px
- Border width: 3px

**At 200% Zoom** (zoom in twice):
- Place radius: ~40px (2x)
- Transition size: ~80x40px (2x)
- Arc line width: **3px** (same!)
- Border width: **3px** (same!)

**At 50% Zoom** (zoom out twice):
- Place radius: ~10px (0.5x)
- Transition size: ~20x10px (0.5x)
- Arc line width: **3px** (same!)
- Border width: **3px** (same!)

**Expected**: Objects scale, lines don't!

---

### ‚úÖ Test 5: Selection at Different Zoom Levels

**Steps**:
1. Zoom to **200%**
2. Deselect tool (click canvas in pan mode)
3. Left-click objects to select them
4. Verify blue highlight appears

**Repeat at**:
- 100% zoom
- 50% zoom
- 25% zoom

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Selection works at all zoom levels
- ‚úÖ Blue highlight always 3px thick
- ‚úÖ Hit testing accurate (click on object ‚Üí selects)
- ‚úÖ Click near object but not on it ‚Üí no selection

---

### ‚úÖ Test 6: Arc Creation with Zoom

**Steps**:
1. Zoom to **200%**
2. Click **[A]** button (arc tool)
3. Click a **place** (source selected)
4. Move mouse ‚Üí Observe orange preview line
5. Click a **transition** (arc created)

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Orange preview line appears
- ‚úÖ Preview line is 2px thick (constant width)
- ‚úÖ Preview follows cursor smoothly
- ‚úÖ Arc created successfully
- ‚úÖ Final arc has 3px line width

**Repeat at different zoom levels** (100%, 50%)

---

### ‚úÖ Test 7: Trackpad Smooth Scroll

**Steps** (if you have a trackpad):
1. Use **two-finger scroll** on trackpad
2. Scroll up ‚Üí Zoom in
3. Scroll down ‚Üí Zoom out

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Smooth zoom (not discrete steps)
- ‚úÖ Same pointer-centered behavior
- ‚úÖ No lag or jitter

**Note**: If smooth scroll doesn't work, discrete scroll wheel should still work.

---

### ‚úÖ Test 8: Panning at Different Zoom Levels

**Steps**:
1. Zoom to **200%**
2. **Right-click + drag** to pan
3. Observe canvas moves smoothly

**Repeat at**:
- 100% zoom
- 50% zoom

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Panning works at all zoom levels
- ‚úÖ Pan speed feels natural
- ‚úÖ No drift or jumping

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Objects Jump When Zooming

**Symptoms**: Object under cursor moves around instead of staying fixed.

**Likely Cause**: Coordinate transformation bug.

**Check**:
```python
# In model_canvas_manager.py:
world_x = (screen_x / self.zoom) - self.pan_x  # Should have MINUS
screen_x = (world_x + self.pan_x) * self.zoom  # Should have PLUS
```

---

### Issue: Lines Get Thicker/Thinner with Zoom

**Symptoms**: Border lines change width when zooming.

**Likely Cause**: Missing zoom compensation in render methods.

**Check**:
```python
# In place.py, transition.py, arc.py:
cr.set_line_width(self.border_width / max(zoom, 1e-6))  # Should have /zoom
```

---

### Issue: Text Becomes Huge/Tiny

**Symptoms**: Labels and token counts scale with zoom.

**Likely Cause**: Font size not compensated.

**Check**:
```python
# In place.py, transition.py, arc.py:
cr.set_font_size(12 / zoom)  # Should have /zoom
```

---

### Issue: Selection Doesn't Work at High Zoom

**Symptoms**: Can't select objects when zoomed in.

**Likely Cause**: Hit testing uses wrong coordinates.

**Check**: Selection code should use `screen_to_world()` to convert click position.

---

## Expected Console Output

**On startup**:
```
GTK3 interface initialized
Model canvas manager created
Drawing area configured
```

**During zoom**:
```
(No console output expected - zoom is silent)
```

**On errors** (shouldn't happen):
```
ERROR: <error message>
Traceback...
```

---

## Performance Notes

### Good Performance
- Zoom in/out: Smooth, no lag
- Panning: Responsive
- Rendering: Instant redraw

### Poor Performance (Possible Issues)
- Lag when zooming ‚Üí Too many objects or complex rendering
- Stuttering ‚Üí Grid rendering too heavy
- Memory usage growing ‚Üí Memory leak in render loop

**Note**: Current implementation should perform well with <100 objects.

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Everything Works ‚úÖ
1. Mark zoom implementation as complete
2. Move on to next feature
3. Consider optional enhancements (zoom buttons, zoom-to-fit)

### If Issues Found ‚ùå
1. Note specific test case that failed
2. Report symptoms and expected vs actual behavior
3. Check likely causes from troubleshooting section
4. Fix and re-test
