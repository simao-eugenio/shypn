## Architectural Guideline: Object-Oriented Design

This project is designed with an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. Core logic, APIs, and UI components are implemented as classes, utilizing principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Contributors are encouraged to structure new modules and features using OOP best practices to ensure maintainability and extensibility.
