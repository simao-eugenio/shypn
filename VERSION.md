# ShyPN - Black Hole Galaxy Physics Engine

## VERSION 2.0.0 - Black Hole Galaxy Physics
**Release Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: PRODUCTION STABLE  
**Commit**: c758960

---

## 🌌 Major Features

### Black Hole Galaxy Model
- SCC (Strongly Connected Component) cycle acts as black hole at galaxy center
- Constellation hubs orbit the black hole like satellites
- Multi-level hierarchical structure (4 levels: galaxy → constellation → hub → satellite)
- Beautiful hierarchical appearance with proper orbital mechanics

### SCC-Aware Gravitational Attraction
- Black hole only attracts constellation hubs (mass ≥ 1000)
- Does NOT affect satellites or shared places
- Creates stable orbital mechanics
- Prevents satellites from being pulled toward black hole

### Black Hole Damping Wave (v1.4.0)
- Distance-based repulsion reduction from black hole center
- Damping formula: `d = 0.1 + 0.9 × (distance / 1000)²`
- Near black hole: 90% repulsion reduction (tight packing)
- Far from black hole: No reduction (normal spreading)
- Creates natural density gradient

### Arc Force Weakening for SCC Connections (v2.0.0) ⭐ **NEW**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Prevents ternary system clustering
- Arcs connecting to/from SCC nodes weakened by 90%
- Arc to constellation hub: 1.2 (normal strength)
- Arc to black hole: 0.12 (10× weaker)
- **Result**: Shared places orbit constellation hubs instead of clustering
- **Effect**: Constellations spread evenly at ~120° spacing around black hole

### Event Horizon Mechanics (Configurable)
- Optional node trapping at event horizon (currently DISABLED)
- Frozen nodes experience zero forces
- Can be enabled for specific physics scenarios

## 🔧 Calibration History

### v2.0.0 (Oct 17, 2025): Black Hole Galaxy with Arc Weakening
**Changes**:
- Added SCC arc weakening (90% reduction) to prevent ternary clustering
- Second global force scaling (70% reduction from v1.5.0 values)
- Cumulative 94% reduction from original forces

**Problem Solved**: Shared places were forming ternary cluster and dragging constellations

**Solution**: 
```python
# Before (Equal arc forces):
Arc to constellation hub: 1.2
Arc to black hole: 1.2
→ Shared places balance in middle, cluster together

# After (Weakened SCC arcs):
Arc to constellation hub: 1.2
Arc to black hole: 0.12 (10× weaker!)
→ Shared places orbit constellation hubs like satellites
```

**Result**: Beautiful hierarchical structure, constellations spread evenly

### v1.5.0: SCC Gravity and Event Horizon
**Changes**:
- Implemented SCC gravitational attraction (only affects hubs)
- Added event horizon trapping mechanics (later disabled)
- First global force scaling (80% reduction)

**Effect**: Constellation hubs orbit black hole at proper distance

### v1.4.0: Black Hole Damping Wave
**Changes**:
- Implemented distance-based repulsion reduction
- Parabolic falloff from black hole center

**Effect**: Visible density gradient, tight packing near black hole

### v1.3.0: Hub Group Repulsion
**Changes**:
- Group-to-group repulsion between constellations
- Combined mass calculations
- Prevents constellation clustering

**Effect**: Constellations maintain separation

### v1.2.0: SCC Cohesion Forces
**Changes**:
- Pulls SCC nodes toward centroid
- Maintains cycle shape with target radius

**Effect**: Black hole stays compact and circular

### v1.1.0: Oscillatory Forces with Equilibrium
**Changes**:
- Arc-based attraction when r > r_eq
- Arc-based repulsion when r < r_eq
- Natural orbital patterns

**Effect**: Satellites orbit hubs naturally

### v1.0.0: Initial Unified Physics
**Changes**:
- Basic arc forces

## 🎯 Key Algorithms

### Arc Weakening for SCC (v2.0.0)
```python
# Location: unified_physics_simulator.py, _calculate_oscillatory_forces()
arc_strength_multiplier = 1.0
if hasattr(self, 'sccs') and self.sccs:
    for scc in self.sccs:
        scc_nodes = set(scc.node_ids)
        if source_id in scc_nodes or target_id in scc_nodes:
            # Reduce by 90%
            arc_strength_multiplier = SCC_ARC_WEAKENING_FACTOR  # 0.1
            break

force_magnitude *= arc_strength_multiplier
```

### Black Hole Damping Wave (v1.4.0)
```python
# Location: unified_physics_simulator.py, _calculate_blackhole_damping()
avg_distance = (dist1 + dist2) / 2.0
MAX_DISTANCE = 1000.0
MIN_DAMPING = 0.1

if avg_distance >= MAX_DISTANCE:
    damping = 1.0
else:
    ratio = avg_distance / MAX_DISTANCE
    damping = MIN_DAMPING + (1.0 - MIN_DAMPING) * (ratio ** 2)
```

### SCC Gravity (v1.5.0)
```python
# Location: unified_physics_simulator.py, _calculate_scc_attraction()
# Only affects nodes with mass >= 1000 (constellation hubs)
if node_mass < SCC_GRAVITY_MIN_MASS:
    continue

# Gravitational force: F = G × m_node × m_scc_total / r²
force_magnitude = (SCC_GRAVITY_CONSTANT * node_mass * 
                   scc_total_mass / (distance ** 2))
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Constellations Clustering
**Symptom**: C2 and C3 too close together, only C1 spreads properly  
**Cause**: Shared places form ternary system, drag constellations  
**Solution**: ✅ FIXED in v2.0.0 with arc weakening (90% reduction)

### Issue: Black Hole Too Loose
**Symptom**: SCC cycle diameter > 200 units  
**Cause**: SCC_COHESION_STRENGTH too weak  
**Solution**: Increase SCC_COHESION_STRENGTH (default: 30,000)

### Issue: Constellations Too Far/Close
**Symptom**: Orbital distance not ideal  
**Cause**: SCC_GRAVITY_CONSTANT not calibrated  
**Solution**: Adjust SCC_GRAVITY_CONSTANT (300 = good distance)

## 🎓 Physics Interpretation

### Black Hole as Gravitational Center
The SCC cycle acts as a unified gravitational attractor:
- Combines mass of all SCC nodes
- Creates gravitational field that pulls constellation hubs
- Does NOT affect satellites (mass < 1000)
- Result: Natural orbital mechanics

### Shared Places as Satellites
With arc weakening (v2.0.0):
- Weak connection to black hole (10× weaker arc force)
- Strong connection to constellation hub (normal arc force)
- Result: Orbit their hub instead of black hole
- No more ternary clustering

### Damping Wave as Density Gradient
Distance-based repulsion reduction:
- Near black hole: 90% reduction → tight packing
- Medium distance: 65% reduction → moderate spacing
- Far from black hole: 0% reduction → normal spreading
- Result: Beautiful hierarchical density gradient
