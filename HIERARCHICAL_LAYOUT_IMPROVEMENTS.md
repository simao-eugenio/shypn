# Hierarchical Layout Improvements

## Date: October 12, 2025

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. ✅ No Curved Arcs for Hierarchical Layouts

**Problem**: Curved arcs add visual complexity to hierarchical layouts where flow is already clear.

**Solution**: Disable arc routing for hierarchical and cross-reference layouts.

**Implementation**:
```python
# In sbml_import_panel.py
layout_type = document_model.metadata.get('layout_type', 'unknown')
enable_arc_routing = layout_type not in ['hierarchical', 'cross-reference']

enhancement_options = EnhancementOptions(
    enable_arc_routing=enable_arc_routing  # Conditional based on layout
)
```

**Logic**:
- **Hierarchical layouts**: Straight arcs (arc routing disabled)
- **Cross-reference layouts**: Straight arcs (positions from database)
- **Force-directed layouts**: Curved arcs (arc routing enabled)
- **Complex networks**: Curved arcs (arc routing enabled)

**Benefit**: Cleaner visual appearance for vertical flow pathways.

### 2. ✅ Equal Spacing Between Neighbors in Each Layer

**Problem**: Species in the same layer had inconsistent spacing, making layout look unbalanced.

**Solution**: Distribute species evenly within each layer with equal horizontal spacing.

**Implementation**:
```python
# In hierarchical_layout.py - _position_layers()
if num_species == 1:
    # Single element: center it
    positions[species_id] = (canvas_center_x, y)
else:
    # Multiple elements: distribute evenly
    total_width = (num_species - 1) * horizontal_spacing
    start_x = canvas_center_x - total_width / 2
    
    for i, species_id in enumerate(layer_species):
        x = start_x + i * horizontal_spacing
        positions[species_id] = (x, y)
```

**Test Results**:
```
Layer 1 (3 species):
  Species B: X=300.0
  Species C: X=400.0  ← Center
  Species D: X=500.0

Horizontal spacings: [100.0, 100.0]
✓ Equal spacing: 100.0 pixels
✓ Layer is centered (offset: 0.0 pixels)
```

**Benefit**: Balanced, professional-looking layouts.

### 3. ✅ Reactions Positioned Between Layers

**Problem**: Reactions were positioned on the same layer as species, causing visual overlap.

**Solution**: Position reactions between their reactant and product layers.

**Implementation**:
```python
# In hierarchical_layout.py - _position_reactions()
# Average position of reactants
reactant_y = sum(y for x, y in reactant_coords) / len(reactant_coords)

# Average position of products
product_y = sum(y for x, y in product_coords) / len(product_coords)

# Position reaction BETWEEN layers (halfway in Y)
avg_y = (reactant_y + product_y) / 2
```

**Test Results**:
```
Species S1: Y=100.0
Reaction R1: Y=175.0  ← Between S1 and S2
Species S2: Y=250.0
Reaction R2: Y=325.0  ← Between S2 and S3
Species S3: Y=400.0

✓ R1 is between S1 and S2
✓ R2 is between S2 and S3
✓ No reactions on species layers (kept separate)
```

**Benefit**: Clear separation between species and reactions, no visual overlap.

## Layout Type Metadata System

### Metadata Flow

```
Post-Processing → Converter → DocumentModel → SBML Import Panel
```

1. **Post-processor** sets `processed_data.metadata['layout_type']`
2. **Converter** copies to `document.metadata['layout_type']`
3. **Import panel** reads it to decide on arc routing

### Layout Types

| Type | Arc Routing | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `cross-reference` | ❌ Disabled | KEGG/Reactome coordinates |
| `hierarchical` | ❌ Disabled | Dependency-based vertical layout |
| `force-directed` | ✅ Enabled | NetworkX spring layout |
| `circular` | ✅ Enabled | Cyclic pathways (future) |
| `grid` | ✅ Enabled | Simple grid fallback |

## Visual Comparison

### Before Improvements

```
Curved arcs:
  Species A ⤴️
         ↙ ↘
  Species B  Species C  ← Uneven spacing
         ↘ ↙
       Reaction ← On same layer as species
         ↓
  Species D
```

**Issues**:
- Curved arcs add visual noise
- Uneven spacing between B and C
- Reaction overlaps with species

### After Improvements

```
Straight arcs:
       Species A
          ↓
       Reaction      ← Between layers
        ↙    ↘
  Species B   Species C  ← Equal spacing
        ↘    ↙
       Reaction      ← Between layers
          ↓
       Species D
```

**Benefits**:
- Clean straight lines for vertical flow
- Even spacing looks professional
- Clear separation between elements

## Test Coverage

### Test 1: Horizontal Spacing
**File**: `test_hierarchical_improvements.py`

```python
# Create pathway with 3 parallel products
A → B, C, D → E

# Verify:
✓ All species in layer at same Y
✓ Equal spacing (100px between each)
✓ Layer centered around X=400
```

**Result**: ✅ PASSED

### Test 2: Reaction Positioning
**File**: `test_hierarchical_improvements.py`

```python
# Create linear pathway
S1 → R1 → S2 → R2 → S3

# Verify:
✓ R1 between S1 and S2 (Y: 100 → 175 → 250)
✓ R2 between S2 and S3 (Y: 250 → 325 → 400)
✓ No reactions on species layers
```

**Result**: ✅ PASSED

### Test 3: Real SBML File
**File**: `test_sbml_hierarchical_layout.py`

```
BIOMD0000000001.xml:
✓ 12 species, 17 reactions
✓ Detected as hierarchical
✓ 6 layers created
✓ Layout type: hierarchical
✓ Arc routing: disabled
```

**Result**: ✅ PASSED

The improvements are now part of the complete SBML import pipeline:

```
SBML File
   ↓
Parse (SBMLParser)
   ↓
Post-Process (PathwayPostProcessor)
   ├─ Try cross-reference → set layout_type='cross-reference'
   ├─ Try hierarchical → set layout_type='hierarchical' ← IMPROVED
   └─ Fallback → set layout_type='force-directed'
   ↓
Convert (PathwayConverter)
   └─ Copy layout_type to document.metadata
   ↓
Import Panel (sbml_import_panel.py)
   ├─ Read layout_type
   ├─ Disable arc routing if hierarchical ← NEW
   └─ Enable arc routing if force-directed
   ↓
Render (straight arcs for hierarchical) ✓
```
