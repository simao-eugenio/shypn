# Arc Editing - Current State

## Date: October 6, 2025

## Current Implementation Status: ✅ ACCEPTABLE

The arc editing system is now in a stable and acceptable state for production use. This document summarizes the current implementation and identifies areas for potential future enhancements.

---

## Current Features

### ✅ Working Features

1. **Single Arc Editing**
   - Double-click to enter edit mode
   - Drag control handle to create curved arcs
   - Visual feedback with blue highlight and handle
   - Works for both Arc and InhibitorArc types

2. **Parallel Arc Handling**
   - Automatic detection of parallel arcs (same source/target nodes)
   - Automatic curve application to avoid overlap
   - **Parallel arcs are NOT editable** (by design)
   - System-managed curvature prevents user confusion

3. **Context Menu - Transform Arc**
   - ✅ Convert to Inhibitor Arc (only for Place → Transition)
   - ✅ Convert to Normal Arc (for existing inhibitor arcs)
   - ❌ "Make Straight" / "Make Curved" removed (handled via drag)

4. **Context Menu - Arc Properties**
   - Edit Properties dialog
   - Edit Weight option
   - Delete option
   - **"Edit Mode" option hidden for parallel arcs**

5. **Direction Validation**
   - Inhibitor arc conversion only offered for Place → Transition arcs
   - Transition → Place arcs cannot be converted to inhibitor (correctly forbidden)

6. **Drag Handle System**
   - Control point appears at arc midpoint (or calculated curve point)
   - Accounts for parallel arc offsets
   - Updates in real-time during drag
   - Persists curve state with `is_curved` flag

### ✅ Recent Fixes Applied

- **Commit `4a0069f`**: Context menu helpers and parallel arc transformation
- **Commit `fe1192d`**: Removed "Make Straight/Curved" from context menu
- **Commit `ddab07d`**: Disabled edit mode for parallel arcs
- **Commit `c66df7b`**: Fixed inhibitor arc conversion validation

## Design Decisions

### Why Parallel Arcs Are Not Editable

**Rationale:**
- Parallel arcs are automatically curved by the system to avoid visual overlap
- Their curvature is calculated algorithmically based on:
  - Number of parallel arcs
  - Arc IDs for stable ordering
  - Perpendicular offset from center line
- Manual editing would conflict with automatic positioning
- Prevents user confusion and maintains visual consistency

**Implementation:**
- `detect_parallel_arcs()` checks for arcs with same source/target
- Double-click on parallel arc only selects, doesn't enter edit mode
- Context menu hides "Edit Mode (Double-click)" option
- System maintains full control over parallel arc curves

### Why "Make Straight/Curved" Was Removed

**Rationale:**
- Direct manipulation via drag handles is more intuitive
- Users can see the curve as they create it
- Reduces menu clutter
- Flag-based system (`is_curved`) works better with drag interaction
- Previous implementation had conflicts with legacy class-based system

### Why Inhibitor Conversion Has Direction Check

**Rationale:**
- SHYPN uses "cooperation semantics" for inhibitor arcs
- Inhibitor arcs represent: "Place shares tokens only when it has surplus"
- Only Place → Transition makes semantic sense
- Transition → Place inhibitor has no valid interpretation
- Prevents creation of semantically invalid nets

### Data Model

**Arc Properties:**
```python
arc.is_curved = True/False          # Flag-based curve state
arc.control_offset_x = float        # Manual curve offset X
arc.control_offset_y = float        # Manual curve offset Y
arc.source = Place/Transition       # Source node
arc.target = Place/Transition       # Target node
```

**Parallel Arc Detection:**
```python
parallels = manager.detect_parallel_arcs(arc)
# Returns: List of arcs with same source/target
# Empty list = single arc (editable)
# Non-empty = parallel arc (not editable)
```

## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints

1. **Parallel Arcs Cannot Be Manually Curved**
   - System-managed only
   - User cannot fine-tune curve amount
   - **Status**: By design, acceptable

2. **Single Curve Point Per Arc**
   - Only one control handle
   - Cannot create S-curves or complex paths
   - **Status**: Acceptable for most use cases

3. **Curve Reset on Straighten**
   - No "undo" for curve operations
   - Must re-drag to recreate curve
   - **Status**: Minor inconvenience

4. **No Bezier Control**
   - Uses quadratic curve calculation
   - Not true Bezier with multiple control points
   - **Status**: Adequate for Petri net visualization

## Future Enhancement Ideas

### Potential Improvements (Not Currently Planned)

#### 1. **Advanced Curve Editing**
   - Multiple control points
   - Bezier curve support
   - S-curve capability
   - Custom curve shapes

#### 2. **Parallel Arc Manual Override**
   - Allow fine-tuning of auto-generated curves
   - "Lock" curve to prevent auto-adjustment
   - Manual spacing control
   - **Challenge**: Conflicts with auto-positioning logic

#### 3. **Arc Routing Intelligence**
   - Automatic path finding around obstacles
   - Smart curve generation to avoid node overlap
   - Orthogonal routing option
   - **Complexity**: High, requires pathfinding algorithm

#### 4. **Curve Presets**
   - "Gentle curve", "Sharp curve", "Loop" presets
   - One-click curve application
   - Save/load custom curves
   - **Benefit**: Faster workflow for power users

#### 5. **Visual Curve Editor**
   - Dedicated curve editor dialog
   - Numeric input for offset values
   - Preview before apply
   - **Use case**: Precise curve control

#### 6. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `C` = Toggle curve on/off
   - `Shift + Drag` = Constrain curve direction
   - `Ctrl + Drag` = Fine adjustment mode
   - **Benefit**: Faster for experienced users

#### 7. **Context Menu Improvements**
   - "Reset Curve" option
   - "Mirror Curve" option
   - "Smooth Curve" option
   - **Benefit**: More curve manipulation options

## Testing Recommendations

### Current Test Coverage

**Manual Testing Required:**
- ✅ Double-click single arc → Enter edit mode
- ✅ Drag handle → Arc curves
- ✅ Double-click parallel arc → Only select (no edit)
- ✅ Right-click Place→Transition arc → Shows "Convert to Inhibitor"
- ✅ Right-click Transition→Place arc → No inhibitor option
- ✅ Right-click inhibitor arc → Shows "Convert to Normal"
- ✅ Edit Mode option hidden for parallel arcs

### Automated Tests (Future)

**Unit Tests Needed:**
```python
test_detect_parallel_arcs()
test_parallel_arc_not_editable()
test_inhibitor_direction_validation()
test_curve_flag_persistence()
test_control_offset_calculation()
```

**Integration Tests Needed:**
```python
test_double_click_workflow()
test_context_menu_options()
test_drag_handle_updates_curve()
test_parallel_arc_auto_curve()
```

## Migration Notes

### From Legacy System

The current implementation uses a **hybrid approach**:

1. **New System (Preferred)**:
   - `Arc` class with `is_curved` flag
   - `control_offset_x/y` for manual curves
   - Flag-based state management

2. **Legacy System (Deprecated)**:
   - `CurvedArc` class (separate class)
   - Automatic curve calculation
   - Class-based state management

**Status**: Both systems coexist for backward compatibility. New arcs use the flag-based system.

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance: ✅ Good

- Parallel arc detection: O(n) where n = number of arcs
- Handle detection: O(1) per arc
- Curve calculation: O(1) per arc
- Context menu generation: O(1)

**No performance issues reported.**

---

## Conclusion

The current arc editing implementation is **stable and acceptable** for production use. It provides essential functionality for creating curved arcs while preventing common user errors (parallel arc confusion, invalid inhibitor directions).

Future enhancements should focus on:
1. Advanced curve control (if user demand exists)
2. Automated routing intelligence
3. Better visual feedback

**Current Priority**: Monitor user feedback to identify most valuable improvements.
