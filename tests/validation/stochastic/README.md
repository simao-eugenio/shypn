# Stochastic Transition Validation Tests

**Purpose:** Fast functional correctness tests for stochastic transitions.

**Status:** ðŸ”œ **PLANNED** - Phase 3

## Overview

Stochastic transitions fire based on exponential distribution. Validation tests will verify:

1. **Stochastic Firing** - Exponential distribution works
2. **Guard Functions** - Guards with stochastic delays
3. **Priority Resolution** - Conflicts with randomness
4. **Arc Weights** - Token flow correctness
5. **Source/Sink** - Stochastic special behaviors
6. **Persistence** - Properties persist correctly
7. **Statistical Checks** - Basic distribution validation

## Coming Soon

Tests will be developed after timed transition validation is complete.
