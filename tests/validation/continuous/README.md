# Continuous Transition Validation Tests

**Purpose:** Fast functional correctness tests for continuous transitions.

**Status:** ðŸ”œ **PLANNED** - Phase 4

## Overview

Continuous transitions use ODE/rate functions for continuous token flow. Validation tests will verify:

1. **Rate Functions** - ODE evaluation works correctly
2. **Guard Functions** - Guards with continuous rates
3. **Priority Resolution** - Conflicts with continuous flow
4. **Arc Weights** - Token flow correctness
5. **Source/Sink** - Continuous special behaviors
6. **Persistence** - Properties persist correctly
7. **Numerical Checks** - Basic integration validation

## Coming Soon

Tests will be developed after stochastic transition validation is complete.
