Issue 1: Test Arc Rendering
   Problem: Renders center-to-center instead of perimeter-to-perimeter
   Root Cause: TestArc.render() doesn't use _get_boundary_point()
   Fix: Update TestArc.render() to use boundary calculations
   Priority: MEDIUM (visual quality)

Issue 2: Isolated Catalyst Places
   Problem: Some enzyme places have no test arcs
   Root Cause: Test arc creation fails when enzyme.reaction doesn't match transition
   Fix: Either skip enzyme place creation or add visual indicator
   Priority: LOW (edge case in malformed data)

Issue 3: Catalysts Not Positioned by Layout
   Problem: Enzyme places not positioned by hierarchical layout
   Root Cause: Layout only processes dependency graph (reactants/products)
   Fix: Add _position_enzymes() method after main layout
   Priority: HIGH (affects all biological models)

Issue 4: "Disruption" Clarification
   Problem: Not actual disruption, but missing positioning
   Root Cause: Same as Issue 3 - catalysts ignored by layout
   Fix: Same as Issue 3 - position enzymes separately
   Priority: HIGH (same as Issue 3)

Recommended Action Plan:
   1. Fix Issue 3/4: Implement enzyme positioning (HIGH priority)
   2. Fix Issue 1: Update test arc rendering (MEDIUM priority)
   3. Fix Issue 2: Handle isolated enzymes gracefully (LOW priority)
