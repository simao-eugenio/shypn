# Timed Transition Benchmark Tests

**Purpose:** Performance and systematic evaluation tests for timed transitions.

**Status:** ðŸ”œ **PLANNED** - Phase 2

## Overview

Timed transitions fire after a specified delay/timeout. Test categories will include:

1. **Delay Mechanism** - Fixed delays, timeout handling
2. **Guard Functions** - Guards with delays
3. **Priority Resolution** - Conflict resolution with delays  
4. **Arc Weights** - Token consumption with timed firing
5. **Rate Expressions** - Delay calculation expressions
6. **Source/Sink** - Timed generation/consumption
7. **Persistence** - Save/load delay properties
8. **Edge Cases** - Zero delay, infinite delay, negative delay
9. **UI Dialog** - Timed-specific property validation

## Coming Soon

Tests will be developed after immediate transition validation is complete.
