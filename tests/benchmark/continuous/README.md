# Continuous Transition Benchmark Tests

**Purpose:** Performance and systematic evaluation tests for continuous transitions.

**Status:** ðŸ”œ **PLANNED** - Phase 4

## Overview

Continuous transitions use ODE/rate functions for continuous token flow. Test categories will include:

1. **Rate Functions** - ODE evaluation and integration
2. **Guard Functions** - Guards with continuous rates
3. **Priority Resolution** - Conflict resolution with continuous flow
4. **Arc Weights** - Continuous token consumption/production
5. **Rate Expressions** - Complex ODE expressions (math, numpy, scipy)
6. **Source/Sink** - Continuous generation/consumption
7. **Persistence** - Save/load rate functions
8. **Numerical Stability** - Integration accuracy
9. **UI Dialog** - Continuous-specific property validation

## Coming Soon

Tests will be developed after stochastic transition validation is complete.
