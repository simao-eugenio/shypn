# Stochastic Transition Benchmark Tests

**Purpose:** Performance and systematic evaluation tests for stochastic transitions.

**Status:** ðŸ”œ **PLANNED** - Phase 3

## Overview

Stochastic transitions fire based on exponential distribution. Test categories will include:

1. **Stochastic Firing** - Exponential distribution behavior
2. **Guard Functions** - Guards with stochastic firing
3. **Priority Resolution** - Conflict resolution with randomness
4. **Arc Weights** - Token flow with stochastic delays
5. **Rate Expressions** - Rate-based firing distribution
6. **Source/Sink** - Stochastic generation/consumption
7. **Persistence** - Save/load stochastic properties
8. **Statistical Validation** - Distribution verification
9. **UI Dialog** - Stochastic-specific property validation

## Coming Soon

Tests will be developed after timed transition validation is complete.
